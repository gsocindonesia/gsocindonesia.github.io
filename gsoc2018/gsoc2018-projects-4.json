You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jC07WJ0bFpZFV_QcSPsLCqV_qG0TYR1dHi_Zk9ZV6usiie35fQqXd2YQk3A0mZ53S3mGs0uXh6KbwcxKj0QuCD83UIGGag","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/debian","blog_url":"https://planet.debian.org/","application_instructions":"Individual projects are highlighted on the [projects list](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects).

This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\n\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PxFw8wDQUkPqz5ZVyRaSbNAqQpEotHzm-9_2nsRtf1UpUkX_-UqfAUvmmvVwekrFUrrPbEsPjzFhAwAugQG4EpxwS5WAkA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"(Also available here: https://goo.gl/sR2tnN)\n\nWe would like to know who you are and how you think.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":5027157588312064,"display_name":"Rahul Jha (~RJ722)","program_year":2018},"abstract":"The aim of this project is to:\n* Write a script which would automatically parse sip files for PyQt - a special format which creates Python bindings for C and C++ libraries (available as Python extension modules) and then, generate a whitelist from that.\n* Create a maintainable whitelist for the latest version of PyQt to be shipped with vulture by default.","assignee_display_names":["Jendrik Seipp","The Compiler","Abdeali Kothari"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5623404812566528,"title":"MIDI support for Godot Engine","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":4912402089377792,"name":"Godot Engine","slug":"godot-engine","website_url":"https://godotengine.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"contact@godotengine.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://godotengine.org/community","tagline":"Godot is a multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine with a feature-rich editor","precis":"With a feature-packed and cross-platform 2D and 3D editor, Godot is today's most mature FOSS game engine with an ever growing worldwide community of contributors and users.","description":"[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.

For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/uPrh_zcYp8CqY-ZRhss_xilMEfuxv-pHZywKZrdlRR1_3EslMluFLRVKkH1YaBAFCajGlyIYTMrv7XjWPxHFXj12rlAS1fZg","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"https://medium.com/oppia-org","application_instructions":"# Applying to Oppia\nPlease take a look at our dedicated GSoC 2018 wiki page [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018) for information about project ideas, what we’re looking for in a proposal, a proposal template, and how to apply to our organization.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\n\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/8TWDMTm6AHMZJdvvsJ4L_bt9r4WehaOa3o_iygorlZc0XhnBWEifLrJtISrNAMiUpUSLoSf3peNulu47pVIt7AAI1dBid3Si","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CKCUu4iWJwdYiZN3iTns4NDVc-_rPltAk4ktzHQJcmfVsZQRHZRJlhHUlUge-Ahe3O3CrnONguwIEbfsJsTpBy1BzYtqfHU","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/diyclassics","blog_url":"http://cltk.org/blog/","application_instructions":"See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas) for a list of tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginning-to-intermediate programmer.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.

[ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide.

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.

FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack.

The website will be developed using VueJS which makes it easy to maintain and the website will merge the currently existing websites and produce a consistent and modern UI and a better UX.","assignee_display_names":["YoYehudi"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5716810956013568,"title":"Developing Badgeyey into a complete Macro Service","subcategory":"web","organization":{"id":4799958788603904,"name":"FOSSASIA","slug":"fossasia-3","website_url":"https://fossasia.org","category":"web","contact_email":"fossasia@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/fossasia","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/fossasia/fossasia","tagline":"Improve People's Lives","precis":"Improving people's lives around the world with software and hardware for conversational AIs, science and event management.","description":"FOSSASIA develops Open Source software and hardware for conversational AIs, science and event management with a global developer community from its base in Asia.

We're looking for your help and ideas to apply AI to the proofreading problem, for example by using a seq2seq approach like in machine translation.\n\nLanguageTool is also an end user application, and users want LanguageTool to be integrated in the software they already use.

DT derived indices, such as mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy, can correlate with major tissue damage, but lack sensitivity and specificity to subtle pathological changes. \nMicrostructure Imaging of Crossing (MIX) is versatile and thus suitable to a broad range of generic multicompartment models, in particular for brain areas where axonal pathways cross. \n\nMulticompartment models (assess the variability of diffusion in sub-voxel regions) enable the estimation of more specific indices and so potentially give much greater insight into tissue architecture.\n\nGoal of Model Fitting: Identify which model compartments are essential to explain the data and parameters that are potentially estimable from a particular experiment and compare the models to each other using the BIC.","assignee_display_names":["Mauro Zucchelli","Rafael Neto Henriques","Maryam"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5728789686910976,"title":"[Wikimedia Commons app] Allow users to browse Commons from app","subcategory":"google-summer-of-code (2018)","organization":{"id":5743496112111616,"name":"Wikimedia Foundation","slug":"wikimedia-foundation","website_url":"http://wikimediafoundation.org/","category":"web","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l","irc_channel":"https://wikimedia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/gsoc18-outreachy16","tagline":"Global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world","precis":"Global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world.","description":"We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being.

To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.

You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).\n\n**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones.

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

One important feature that is still missing, is the ability of downloading datasets with minimal effort. Datasets are logical collections of files and are a common way of structuring data in Rucio. Although it is already possible to download single files through the web interface, to download a dataset the user would need to manually download file after file. The need of authentication to the storage system using certificates further complicates the process and for a single file download the certificate has to be selected for each download separately. Thus, the solution is to create web browser extensions, which will handle the authentication and automatically download the selected files of a given dataset.\nThus, this project aims to develop a browser extension which will achieve following objectives - handle metalink files generated by the Rucio backend, handle authentication, automatically download the selected files of a given dataset and do automatic failover if multiple replicas are reported in the metalink.","assignee_display_names":["Martin Barisits","Thomas Beermann","Mario Lassnig"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5768736909295616,"title":"Introduce Architecture and Separate Components","subcategory":"modularization","organization":{"id":5337329930076160,"name":"Catrobat","slug":"catrobat","website_url":"http://catrobat.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"contact@catrobat.org","mailing_list":"http://catrob.at/mailinglist","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Computational Thinking for all through visual programming on phones","precis":"We want to enable especially teenagers to learn how to code and how to create their own games, animations or apps in a user-friendly framework by sticking together simple blocks.","description":"The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time.

Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/EJ7vLvAQgTYtEf213LNLThezRCTdu8dPMY2n5X9I_1kNMQdV9pfz9D_GBk1dTv3RSiOsEo6KmKnRbnf1wNMOW3hsAnQ4Og","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"https://blog.openmrs.org/","application_instructions":"Students interested in applying to GSoC 2018 to work on an OpenMRS project are asked to complete a Google Summer of Code 2018 application and provide the following information:\n# Who are you?

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions.

These aren't just bug-finding tools.  Our tools give a guarantee, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

By allowing kernel scripting, a user may create scripts in Lua to customize their kernel to suit their needs. Modern day kernels, such as Linux, work on a highly concurrent environment, and therefore must use robust synchronization APIs to ensure data consistency, with each API having their own use cases. \n\nThe Read-copy-update (RCU) is one of those APIs, made specifically for scenarios where data reading is much more common than writing. RCU allows concurrent readers to access protected data in a non-blocking way even during updates or removals. RCU, as with the rest of the Linux Kernel, is written in C.\n\nThe project idea is a binding of RCU for use in Lunatik, thus allowing synchronization of Lua data via RCU.","assignee_display_names":["Pedro Tammela","Ana Lucia de Moura"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5787175673659392,"title":"Improve User Interface of the Data Ingest Workflow in PEcAn","subcategory":"linking databases and data types","organization":{"id":4612291316678656,"name":"PEcAn Project","slug":"pecan-project","website_url":"http://pecanproject.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"pecanproj@gmail.com","mailing_list":"http://pecanproject.github.io/contact.html","irc_channel":"http://pecanproject.github.io/contact.html","tagline":"Develop accessible tools for reproducible ecosystem modeling and forecasting","precis":"PEcAn is an integrated ecoinformatics toolbox that consists of a set of scientific workflows that wrap around ecosystem models and manage flow of information in and out of models.","description":"# Why PEcAn? #\nClimate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.

In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project will apply machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms.

This creates two problems: MBTiles add overhead, which decreases the app's performance; and MBTiles need to first be created and stored locally on the phone's external storage when preparing deployments if poor Internet connectivity is to be expected.\nFurthermore, OpenMapKit on Android provides no means of editing map polylines, such as splitting them, through the app itself. This has to be done by adding a reference point in the app, then manually editing the back-end to split the road, to then add information about each new road, which is not only very inefficient but error prone.\nAs such, these two issues will be addressed throughout the GSoC period. The first issue will be fixed by allowing the app to read raw vector data (.osm files, which are XML based). To do so, the new Mapbox GL SDK will be used, since it uses Mapbox Vector Tiles instead of MBTiles. The second issue will be fixed by automating the editing process that is now done manually, providing the appropriate functionality in the app to do so.","assignee_display_names":["danbjoseph","Nate Smith"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5804338899845120,"title":"Improving traffic obfuscation capabilities of the Bitmask VPN","subcategory":"vpn","organization":{"id":5637699893985280,"name":"LEAP Encryption Access Project","slug":"leap-encryption-access-project","website_url":"https://leap.se","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"info@leap.se","mailing_list":"https://leap.se/en/docs/get-involved/communication","irc_channel":"https://leap.se/en/docs/get-involved/communication","tagline":"We make encryption easy to use.","precis":"We make end-to-end encryption widely available and easy to use.","description":"LEAP is a dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.\n\nOn the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\n\nThe LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mFSTc-0kBDxavaRe7oDS5b7Rz8f-b8kleQbgWShrg5F5eta1a0F2FOp3QFKD7DS1KhT7gNO1WkbP5Cr758NtEVYMT4MlJ_jw","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/leapcode","blog_url":"https://leap.se/en/about-us/news","application_instructions":"Hi!

The traditional loss-based TCP algorithms like TCP CUBIC, reduce their sending rates greatly when detecting packet loss, and increase rates conservatively when no packets loss happens. However, it is hard to estimate the network condition just on basis of one metric, i.e, packet loss. As a consequence, loss-based TCP algorithms underutilize network during most of the time, but cause severe congestion occasionally. \n\nTCP BBR is a new variation of TCP algorithm which adjusts its sending rate based on the real-time network metric, i.e, packet round trip time (RTT), the delivered rate (goodput). It is optimal that the amount of traffic walking through a network link is just equal to the well-known bandwidth delay production (BDP). Hence, TCP BBR uses RTT and goodput to constrict the amount of traffic in flight is equal to BDP. In this way, TCP BBR can maximize the goodput, and minimize the RTT at the same time.\n\nAs a high-performance network stack, it is very important for Seastar to provide such high-performance TCP algorithm to further upgrade the performance.","assignee_display_names":["Asias He"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5820221017817088,"title":"OpenHealth App development","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5449481173073920,"name":"Stony Brook University Biomedical Informatics","slug":"stony-brook-university-biomedical-informatics","website_url":"https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"stonybrookbmigsoc@gmail.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/stonybrookbmigsoc","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Advance biomedical knowledge through innovative data science research","precis":"The mission of the Department of Biomedical Informatics of Stony Brook University is to advance biomedical knowledge through innovative data science education and research.","description":"Healthcare enterprises are producing large amounts of data through electronic medical records, medical imaging, health insurance claims, surveillance, and others.

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

One of the missing functions in this package is the [Control System Designer tool](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/controlsystemdesigner-app.html)  . This tool, also called siso tool, is used in Control System, Linear System, Modern Control class and many others. This tool has been used in courses related to control theory to teach students how to design linear controllers by interactive tools. Therefore, the students can add the controller to the plant interactively and configure it, such as, adding poles and zeros in the root locus diagram, or even add common controller types: PD, PID, Lead and Lag controller for example. The goal of this proposal is to create an **Interactive Tool for SISO Linear Control System Design** which is a missing feature in octave compared to Matlab and is significantly helpful for the students who are learning how to design controllers for linear plants.","assignee_display_names":["Douglas Stewart","John Swensen"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5844076742574080,"title":"TSCN exporter for Blender","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":4912402089377792,"name":"Godot Engine","slug":"godot-engine","website_url":"https://godotengine.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"contact@godotengine.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://godotengine.org/community","tagline":"Godot is a multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine with a feature-rich editor","precis":"With a feature-packed and cross-platform 2D and 3D editor, Godot is today's most mature FOSS game engine with an ever growing worldwide community of contributors and users.","description":"[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.

This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kWqF0bT_hHDVRLhg2pJhsFghmGZEWTTIqBSe5XOZKNDMyObRv__UjSH8d-Sf6eqvBxglXqtAD3u93Qzgqbv9vz4B_0-IXJo","image_bg_color":"000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level systems type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through interesting data analysis, to data presentation projects building more effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org.

On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.

This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XZtF21KXmGML9y6r8kIzbSt-EhusHemjuu3rvKadbF99hEg-45YcSys1-VYheAMvAZjbgmbpTfbsgBkxTDGSgS_9sq6phc8","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/pybeeware","blog_url":"http://pybee.org/news/","application_instructions":"To begin the application process, fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gcnGF28SuxbezZj72), providing your resume, and an essay, **no more than 1 page in length**, that covers the following three points:\n\n* Tell your story.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

The current R packages have limitations of using simple methods like linear models or propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effects in the population or at subgroup levels, which ignores the heterogeneity in the large observed data. Besides, these packages only focus on point-in-time estimates.

We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

It allows you to easily create, copy, move, delete, backup, restore partitions and resize without losing data. The program consists of a backend library, called kpmcore, and a user application that uses that library.\n\nCalamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support. It uses the kpmcore library to automate partitioning procedures.\n\nOne pending feature request for Calamares remains for LVM support. LVM support is currently finished in kpmcore and KDE Partition Manager, but there is some work to do in Calamares before proceeding to the other goals of this project. Furthermore, it is currently needed to implement RAID support in kpmcore, KDE Partition Manager and Calamares, which will offer a way to spread data across several disks, such that a single disk failure will not lose that data.","assignee_display_names":["Andrius Štikonas","Adriaan de Groot"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5934527680086016,"title":"BeagleBoot","subcategory":"bootloader","organization":{"id":5740586020110336,"name":"BeagleBoard.org Foundation","slug":"beagleboardorg-foundation","website_url":"https://beagleboard.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"info@beagleboard.org","mailing_list":"https://beagleboard.org/discuss","irc_channel":"https://beagleboard.org/chat","tagline":"Open hardware and software for physical computing","precis":"Open source community of experienced hackers, hobbyists and engineers enthusiastic about building powerful, systems completely programmable through your browser","description":"BeagleBoard.org is an open source community of experienced hackers, hobbyists and engineers who are enthusiastic about building powerful, open ARM-based systems completely programmable through your web browser.
