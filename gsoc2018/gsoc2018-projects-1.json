                "description": "More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

This means that each student who wants to have chances to be picked for a LibreOffice project will need to build the whole application, fix a bug and submit the patch to the development mailing list.\n\nExplain what you want to achieve. Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.\n\nProblems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our [mentoring@documentfoundation.org](mailto:mentoring@documentfoundation.org) address.",

We're asking bc unfortunately, we don't have the resources to help you learn basic programming skills in the languages/frameworks we use. Please give us a feel for the kind of projects you have been working on so far.\n4) Think equally carefully about what you want to learn in the next year, so we can help you achieve your learning goal during the summer and thereafter. \n5) For a successful application a (well) thought out plan on how to reach your project's goal is necessary.  6) #5 will require you already start hacking on some smaller things/preparations beforehand. Also it helps us getting a feel for how we work together :)\n\n### Next Steps\nStill interested? Great!\n\n1) Drop by in our Slack channel and say 'hi' in #intros. Include some trivia information about you and add the answers to the questions 3 & 4.\n2) Then we'll find a suitable test issue to work on for you\n3) Happy hacking :)",

You can also choose any of the GitHub issues if they are big enough to be a qualification task, still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nSteps for the application process\n\n  - Read Google's instructions for participating\n  - Grab any project from the [list of ideas](http://radare.org/gsoc/2018/ideas.html) that you're interested in (or propose your own)\n  - Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing) and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you\n  - Submit it using Google's web interface\n\nHow to fill in the application template\n\n  - Keep it simple enough to fit on no more than a couple of pages. Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

                "description": "Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.\nThe goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.\nThis goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. \nTools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.",

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

                "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.\n\nMany companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like ejabberd, Riak, Phoenix, CouchDB, Zotonic, Nerves project and many more are built on top of it. Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, BarrelDB, a distributed database, LASP, a language for Distributed Eventually consistent computations, and ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others. This gives students a wide range of choices, that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.",

Like any well tested computer system, batteries of tests are run to make sure that the database behaves correctly in typical but also adverse conditions such as network partitions, or even the deployment and upgrade process of nodes running different versions in the same cluster. To this end, one of the resources used by the Riak team is [riak_test](https://github.com/basho/riak_test). Its main function is to provide a test running framework that overlaps significantly with Common Test, but it also contains cluster management and code intercept functionalities. We propose to break up this repository into its discrete components, making important contributions to the Erlang community and adapting the test runner framework into Common Test suites, vastly increasing the reporting ability of current Riak tests.",

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.",

Daniel Pocock's blog \"Want to be selected for GSoC?\" lists some of these steps with more details. This project involves creating a Python script with a GUI that helps applicants and interns complete as many of these steps as possible, in less than an hour. Imagine that a student has only just installed Debian, they install this script from a package using Synaptic and an hour later they have all their accounts, communications tools, development tools and a blog (using Jekyll/Git) up and running.",

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org.

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. \n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

The module should include a well documented API file that can be used by a wide variety of coders, especially those who come after you, and those who are not experts in your problem domain.\n\nYour project should be scaled to the appropriate level of ambition, so that at the end of the summer you have a working product.  Be realistic and honest with yourself about what you think you will be able to accomplish in the course of the summer.  Provide a detailed list of the steps you believe are needed, the tools you propose to use, and a weekly schedule of deliverables.  Clear and proper documentation can take much longer than expected.\n\nIf you are proposing a machine learning project, base the proposal on techniques that have already been successful in other similar projects.  Include as much information about previous research and results as possible.  Accuracy measurements will be required, and they should be as automated as possible.\n\nPlease be prepared to follow code formatting standards closely and to work with Singularity (virtual Linux system) images throughout the summer.",

We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.\n\nWe investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.\n\nOur faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture (\"code\").\n\nAs part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open software platforms for free online lectures and discussions. We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become. We also teach, seeking out online and global opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.\n\nRead more about the Berkman Klein Center at our homepage.",

The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.",

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).",

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning.\n\nSugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities. Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration.\n\n* Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write, share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.\n* Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.\n* Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.\n* The Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.\n* Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.\n* Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.\n* Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.\n* Sugar is largely written and maintained by its users.\n* Sugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.\n* Turtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser.",

                "description": "CloudCV is an open source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of making AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n  \nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.",

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent\nsoftware. It is written in C++, Python and JavaScript, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE\ncommunication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor\nor the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.\n\nJdeRobot include many tools: (a) JdeRobot-Academy, a suite for teaching robotics and computer vision, with 20 motivating exercises; (b) VisualStates, for visual creation of automata that control robot behavior; (c) Scratch2JdeRobot, for programming advanced robots with a full visual language; (d) robot teleoperators, even with web technologies; (e) a tuner for color filters, etc.",

The tool can publish relevant message or subscribe service to change parameter.\n\nNavigation receives configure from GUI node and obstacle information from gazebo. It calls the OMPL api and publish ROS path message. If the robot model is devoted to route, this node should update the new planning path based on new robot pose.\n\nAlthough it just needs a known scenario in claim, I think it is convenience that we can change obstacle position freely. The gazebo plugin for obstacle can publish self-information or subscribe navigation’s service to change obstacle information.\n\nWhen navigation node publish the Path message, a robot model and its path following function is needed to complete this motion. Conveniently, I will use robot models in the JdeRobot such as turtlebot and adrone.\n\nIntegrate all the above and implement the integral ROS gazebo simulation framework.",

The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.\n\n# How does Probot work?\n\nProbot is a Node.js framework based on the [Express Server framework](http://expressjs.com/). It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the `WIP GitHub App` mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master\n\n# Why apply for Probot?\n\nYou will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you :)",

So we have projects that cover a range of interests, despite our core tool being the most amazing subtitle extractor.\n\nAnd now, the official description: Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain while also being fun and simple to use.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include an extensive permissions system, user groups,  hierarchical subforums, file attachments, intuitive notifications, OAuth authentication, support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), and a variety of other features. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a hardened product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have participated in the GSoC program during four prior years. The goal of our mentors is to ensure that all students have a smooth and fulfilling experience. Former phpBB GSoC students have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team. We hope that you will help us continue this excellent trend.",

You should outline what you would like to implement, and how it integrates with the phpBB software. You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).\n\n**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones. We generally like timelines broken down by individual weeks. \n\nIf in doubt, just ask us. We're excited to be working with you!",

                "description": "GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to be:\n\n* Containerized. Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.\n* Dynamically orchestrated. Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.\n* Microservices oriented. Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.\n\nYou can learn more about our organization here: https://cncf.io",

                "description": "coala: Language Independent Code Analysis\n\ncoala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at www.owasp.org.\n\n\nOWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative and open way. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success",

                "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",

I shall work the on the following areas and improve it so the application may move closer towards completion.\n\n* Overhaul and rebuild several major elements of the interface to achieve a more even, symmetric and uniform look.\n\n* Adopt principles of Material Design for the application.\n\n* Fix many small but annoying issues such as broken alignment in some menus, ripple and other effects overflowing into other elements, non-standard icons, animation delays, asymmetric margins etc.\n\n* Improve support for different resolutions and pixel densities so nothing is out of place on a 18.5:9 or 18:9 display, or in landscape mode.\n\n* Add to the documentation and improve it where possible.",

Blender Foundation supports and facilitates these goals - even employs a small staff for that - but fully depends on the online community to achieve it.\n\nSince 2005, Blender has organized a dozen short open films and a game project, which helped Blender tremendously to get more accepted by professionals in their daily work.\n\nWe invite students to think of ways to help us with this further.

            "abstract": "Presently, Learnbot can be programmed to show emotions via a display. However, it does not have the ability to recognize emotions. Having this ability would help improve the Human-Robot Interaction(HRI) functions in Learnbot.\n\nThis project aims at applying state-of-the-art techniques to create a fast, accurate and robust emotion recognizer. It would be able to recognize 7 basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Surprise, Fear and Neutral.\n\nI propose a deep learning based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to make the recognizer more robust and improve the results, I propose different data augmentation techniques and methods to analyze emotions recognized over time.",

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

                "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2018-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea in our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us. Join our IRC channel #jpf on freenode to engage in a discussion about JPF.\n\nIn order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27).

Build tools help to automate those error-prone and daunt tasks with scripts that abstract those tasks. This proposal aims to modernize the build workflow from the Java PathFinder (JPF) project by migrating from Ant to Gradle. Gradle is a general purpose build system and uses Groovy, a JVM language, to create flexible and highly customizable build workflows. To achieve this goal, my strategy is to have a working Gradle build coexisting with the current Ant script. Ant targets will migrate to Gradle tasks in an incremental and iterative process. By the end of the program, is expected to have the Gradle support fully integrated into the main repository.",

This will meet the growing demand for a simple to use, lightweight interface that connects PySAL to different popular visualization toolkits. The `viz` module will ultimately provide the users with both static plots ready for publication and interactive visualizations that allow for quick iteration and data exploration. In a first phase we will therefore create different visualizations in both a static version with Matplotlib and an interactive version with Bokeh. We will then create a common API for easy access to both versions. After adding documentation we will be able to provide a complete and user friendly module. Finally, we will explore how alternative visualization packages, like Vega, could be integrated into the `viz` module in future.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

A new algorithm that has taken the Deep Learning research community by a storm is that of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2015. This algorithm has a lot of potential owing to the fact that it can generate data that is quite similar to the data given for learning in addition to faster generation of samples when compared to fully visible belief nets. It therefore makes GANs immensely useful in simulation of particle physics and astrophysical data.\n\nSince ROOT is a data analysis tool extensively used for applications in particle physics and features a dedicated machine learning submodule, Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), it is essential to include a GAN implementation in the toolkit.\n\nMy project would focus on integrating an optimized GAN implementation in the TMVA DNN library with the help of already existing implementations of Deep Network Models. It would also involve enabling GPU Implementation of GANs using Nvidia’s CUDA library.",

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.",

                "description": "PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.\n\n# Usage\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.",

                "description": "More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

Changes in behavior, new SQL commands, etc. Do not talk about function names, algorithms or data structures here.\n* _How do you want to do it?_ Here you should describe your project in term of internals, function names, algorithms and data structures. What do you want to change and how. Try to show that you know what you're talking about and not simply copied from the project ideas page.\n* _When do you plan to do what?_ Present the timeline here. What will be ready when? Structure your work so that you could test new code immediately, implement your project in small steps that could be tested incrementally. Reserve at least 40% of the time for testing.\nNote, you will almost certainly write a better proposal and will improve your chance of being accepted if you'll discuss your project first on the mailing list or the irc.\nAfter you've filed the proposal, you might receive a reply from a mentor with a test assignment. It will be a small task related to MariaDB code base that will allow you to prove your abilities in C/C++ and setting up a development environment",

It describes how one query is executed, and suggests why the optimizer possibly decides to do so and why it could possibly be fooled by providing inferred and empirical data statistics. But MySQL has a ‘Optimizer trace’ function, which records the decisions of the optimizer and why it made such decisions. So people can know directly what the optimizer thinks from the output of the trace function, and don’t need to guess from ‘EXPLAIN’. MariaDB needs such a feature too.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain while also being fun and simple to use.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include an extensive permissions system, user groups,  hierarchical subforums, file attachments, intuitive notifications, OAuth authentication, support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), and a variety of other features. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a hardened product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have participated in the GSoC program during four prior years. The goal of our mentors is to ensure that all students have a smooth and fulfilling experience. Former phpBB GSoC students have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team.

We're here to assist and happy to walk you through the process.\n\n## Proposal writing tips\nThese are suggestions based on what we have seen work in the past. Of course, there could be many reasons why they do not apply to your particular case, and that is perfectly okay. You can always ask us for help if you have any doubts.\n\nWe have found that good proposals are generally 1-4 pages long, and contains the following sections:\n\n**Introduction**: A few lines about you, your studies, and your qualifications to implement the specific idea. \n\n**Features and design**: This is the most important part of your proposal. You should outline what you would like to implement, and how it integrates with the phpBB software. You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).\n\n**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones. We generally like timelines broken down by individual weeks. \n\nIf in doubt, just ask us. We're excited to be working with you!",

                "description": "CloudCV is an open source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of making AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n  \nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n# Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

You are free to propose an entirely original project or to pick ideas from our GSOC page: \n\nhttps://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC \n\nThe proposal should also include rough weekly goals and broader milestone goals coinciding with the three evaluation phases. We expect inline documentation and javadocs throughout the project, but please notice that wrapping things up and adding \"the final touches\" at the end of the project takes time.\n\nFinally, the proposal should include details about your experience/interests in relation to the GSOC project, but we'd prefer if you didn't include details such as photos, gender, age and other personal details that have no relevance to the project. Full resumes are also not useful.\n\nExpect to stay in daily contact with the project during the work period. Such high visibility helps before too.\n\nFor some further ideas you can search the web for past GSOC proposals and/or check out the following two blog posts from one of our mentors:\n\n* https://skaldarnar.github.io/blog/2017/03/23/convincing-proposal.html\n* https://skaldarnar.github.io/blog/2017/03/29/building-a-timeline.html",

Recently a new module (ModuleTestingEnvironment) was created to\nsupport integration tests, in which a JUnit tests are used to check more than one\ngame component together executing in a headless client. Since the creation of this\nmodule was recent, not much was done using it yet. Besides this, another very\nrequested test feature is the ability to record and replay events of a game session.\nWith these facts in mind, I propose to create an event saving feature, that record all\nEvents of a game session, and extend MTE to be able to create integration tests for\nthe events recorded through this new feature.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

                "description": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

This means that each student who wants to have chances to be picked for a LibreOffice project will need to build the whole application, fix a bug and submit the patch to the development mailing list.\n\nExplain what you want to achieve. Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.\n\nProblems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our [mentoring@documentfoundation.org](mailto:mentoring@documentfoundation.org) address.",

The decision to select a student is made based on the proposal and not in the number of previous contributions. Remember that quality is more important than quantity!\n\n**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.\n\nWe recommend to read http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/",

Automated testing of operating system is important because, installation is a time-consuming process and when a new OS is released, it is not possible to test all possible combinations for installation options in a timely manner, these installation options include, type of image, type of installation medium (USB, DVD, UEFI), operating system options (KDE, GNOME) etc. OpenQA uses image recognition to test the full stack i.e., bootloader, installer and applications.\nOpenQA works by the interaction of three software components i.e., web application, worker and os-autoinst. Container based services are becoming increasingly popular and these services are often packaged into container images. Adding the capability of testing container images into openQA, will provide stable container environments and enhanced testing. The aim of this project is to develop a container backend for openQA. The component os-autoinst already provides various backends such as qemu and integrating container backends like docker and LXC is going to add value to openQA and community.",

                "description": "coala: Language Independent Code Analysis\n\ncoala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.",

This means the website and API are tightly coupled and it's impossible to change one without changing the other.  \n\nCgimap currently supports only a few of the available API calls and all of them are read-onl. To support writing new data to the API, this is going to require some major changes to how cgimap works internally.  \n\nTherefore it is necessary to make OSM editing API faster and performance more transparent.",

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.",

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \n\nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded **16,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).\n\nFind out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB.

Thus, even developers identify a critical bug in the contract it is not possible to push a bugfix in a straightforward way. Thus, in order to fill the gap of not having a proper 'smart contract' compatible monitoring service, SCoRE has propose to build a web application that can monitor other smart contracts in Ethereum and give the capability to safeguard it's critical functions (Ether send and receive) and interact and visualize with smart contract functions in a much simpler way.\n\n\nFor the analysis, Etherbeat has a blockchain extractor, which is currently implemented using python with 4 parallel processing threads.",

                "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

The existing mechanisms involve the HTTP and SFTP in order to transfer the files from the client window. To effectively enable the unified mechanism and collaboration of the files with the quick and reliable way we plan to implement the file upload using Nextcloud API. The APIs of the Nextcloud will be targeted in order to transfer the files from the client window and save the files to the Nextcloud.

These are coordinated by the [Production Department](https://volunteers.joomla.org/departments/production/ \"Joomla Production Department\"). This is an umbrella application for the two projects.\n\nThe Joomla CMS and Joomla Framework are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.\n\nThe Joomla Project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together. The [mission, vision and values](https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/mission-vision-and-values.html \"Joomla Mission vision and values\") of the Joomla Project reflect this. \n\nThe official sponsoring organisation is Open Source Matters (OSM), the not for profit organization that manages financial and legal issues for the Joomla Project.

            "abstract": "Realistic hair or fur is essential when creating a plausible virtual world. In feature animation, this is often used to define the signature look of characters; examples include Pixar’s *Brave* (Iben et al. 2013), and Walt Disney Animation Studios’ *Tangled* (Sadeghi et al. 2010; also Ward et al. 2010) and *Zootopia* (Chiang et al. 2016).\n\nCurrently, Cycles has a working hair shader ([wiki page](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/cycles/nodes/types/shaders/hair.html), [sources](https://git.blender.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi/cycles.git/blob/HEAD:/src/kernel/closure/bsdf_hair.h)), based on Marschner et al. (2003)’s model. Its several assumptions and simplifications make it inaccurate for light colored hair (d’Eon et al. 2011) as well as for most types of fur (Yan et al. 2015). Furthermore, d’Eon et al. (2011) and Khungurn and Marschner (2017) demonstrated it to not be energy conserving.\n\nThis project intends to upgrade Cycles’ hair shader to the aforementioned *Zootopia* shader by Chiang et al. (2016), by porting Pharr (2017)’s implementation.

                "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.",

The resultant polyhedra are exposed to a number of loop optimizations like tiling, vectorization and strip mining.\n\nI propose to integrate Polly’s Optimization passes in Chapel. In today’s world, it is well known that High-Performance Computing involves nested loops as one of their most compute intensive parts which are efficiently handled by Polly-based optimizations, hereby making HPC more productive and going towards more compute-intensive problems which are currently unfeasible.",

                "description": "The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.\n\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

One for extracting data which are present in the form of lists and another for extracting data present in form of tables. These projects have different work-flows and employ different methods for extracting the information. So, the main objective of this project is to develop a single project which can extract lists data and tables data from wikipedia articles.

It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\n\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\n\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\n\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.",

Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

The software enables users to fit HMM with time-homogeneous transitions as well as time-varying transition probabilities. Priors can be set for every model parameter. Implemented inference algorithms include forward (filtering), forward-backwards (smoothing), Viterbi (most likely hidden path), prior predictive sampling, and posterior predictive sampling. Graphs, tables and other convenience methods for convergence diagnosis, goodness of fit, and data analysis are provided.",

A significant challenge in the systems biology field is the reproducibility and reusability of such models and making these accessible to the broader biology community. To address this issue, computer-readable formats and tools for modeling complex biological systems have been developed. Standards such as Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) and tools like Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) can represent such complex biological models and numerically simulate them. But until now only a subset of these standards have been implemented in SBSCL. Essential features that will catalyze reproducibility, exchangeability, and reusability are lacking so far. Namely, i) implementation of full support for simulation experiments; ii) plots and visualization of simulation studies; iii) support for standard archive formats; iv) support for Open Source solvers, and v) support for hierarchical models.",

                "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",

The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it.\n\nAfter that, issue #6932 will then be addressed so we can provide a reliable manner to **forward emails** to a realm's admins based in our current email mirroring tooling.\n\nAnd finally, some improvements to our **i18n** infraestructure: add a string prioritization system that improves translator's workflow by letting them know which strings are more important for us (and therefore should be translated first).",

                "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.",

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nOur goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org).\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference [ORConf](https://orconf.org) with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Gdansk, Poland, on September 21-23.",

This includes (aside from the language itself):\n\n- Compilers\n- Commonly used libraries\n- Commonly used applications written in Haskell\n- Profilers, debuggers and other tools\n- Package managers and infrastructure\n\nWe have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.",

Passing this task will prove that you know how to program in C (or assembler), that you can handle git and - most importantly - that you are able to communicate with us on the mailing list and understand our sometimes complex review process.\n\nTherefore, it is important to get in touch with us as early as possible. Your qualification task is object to the very same review process like every other patch. Usually, many iterations are needed to make a patch acceptable which will take time.\n\n# Apply\n\nBest to prepare your proposal is to get to know our community and communication channels. Subscribe to our development mailing list and join #ffmpeg-devel on the freenode IRC network. You will already be able to gain a lot of insight about us, our rules and procedures by just following discussions on these channels.\n\nNext, write your potential mentor an initial mail to actually dive into your application. Be elaborative about yourself and your interest in the project so that your mentor can adapt to your capabilities in the best possible way. Your mentor will then guide you through your qualification task and possibly through all the rest of a successful Summer of Code.\n\n[Find all details in our Wiki](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2018)",

                "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html#get-started).",

Note that the student manual also includes general information and tips related to open source “culture”, links to additional resources, and examples of typical proposals.\n\nNext you should start to become familiar with Ardupilot as a developer, if you are not already. Read through the [developer section](http://ardupilot.org/dev/index.html) of the [wiki](http://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/index.html), browse through [“Learning the code base”](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/learning-the-ardupilot-codebase.html), and take a look at the [code repository](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) hosted on github.\n\nRead through the suggested list of [proposed GSOC projects](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/gsoc-ideas-list.html). Note that these projects are only suggested, and we are all ears should you have your own ideas for a project.\n\nThen engage with the Ardupilot community. There are several ways you can do this:\n\n* Through our chat [GSOC gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ArduPilot/GSoC)\n* Through our Google Group [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ardupilot-gsoc). (You will need to first request membership there; Shortly thereafter you will be able to send mail or post.)\n* Through our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/c/google-summer-of-code): As with the mailing list you can start a topic introducing yourself, your background and ideas to participate for further discussion.\nAlso feel free to join our [mumble server](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/ardupilot-mumble-server.html) to discuss projects, once you have a good idea of what you would like to work on.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

As a result, various inference can be carried on huge sample sizes at a reasonable computation cost. The idea is to track a small subset of entries in the full frequency spectrum and interpolate to recover the full AFS to proceed with integration for larger sample sizes. The key problem is how to recover the frequency spectrum accurately, so several experiments would be carried out to tune parameters and implementations. Also, a framework is expected to be developed for balancing the trade off between computational complexity and data recovery accuracy, that is, deciding which kind of data should be computed with approximation and which should be computed directly.",

                "description": "In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\n\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.",

We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

The server management is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

Our projects cover a wide range of programming languages and technologies. Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level systems type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through interesting data analysis, to data presentation projects building more effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org. We are looking forwards to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating on something awesome together this summer.",

The tool should be able to generate a report with its findings and their severity so that appropriate action can be taken by the developer.\n\nThese features may include: bugs, configuration mistakes or default configurations left unchanged, unimplemented services, service combinations that wouldn’t make sense on the same machine or on the current operating system, unusual response times, etc.",

                "description": "More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

Kismet is the biggest effort to have such system. However it is far away from being able to detect most of the known attacks. Beside Kismet, there are many small projects dedicated to only one or some WiFi attacks. While they might indeed detect the attacks at stake, they are neither compatible to Kismet nor do they provide detection for a wide range of attacks. Kismet, however, provides a plugin system which only allows loading of additional software written in C++ or as a webapp. \n\nThis may increases the complexity for developers not experienced to C++ or who don't want to familiarize themselves with Kismet. The 'Easily Expandable Wireless Intrusion Detection System' (EEWIDS) tries to overcome this limitation and hereby tries to create a full-featured and expandable solution based on microservice approach. It does not matter in which way a developer plans to detect an attack or even what programming language she/he prefers.",

A student who is interested in their project is more likely to write a good proposal and get accepted. As selecting a project or understanding an idea can be hard, we recommend you come join us [on IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=timvideos) and talk to us further about them. Good students are engaged with the community before GSoC even starts!\n\nOnce you have found a project you are interested in working on, go to the issue tracker for the project and look for bugs marked \"Good First Bug\". These bugs are simple enough that you should with some help be able try to fix them. Submitting a bug fix shows that you have understood the project enough to get things set up and while **not** required is a strong positive signal we will use when assessing your application.\n\nAs mentioned in the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) page, mentors and the community are happy to review applications and give feedback. This will drastically improve the quality of your application and give you a better chance of being accepted.",

                "description": "R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

To ensure that it's relevant, discuss it with Godot developers and use their feedback to write your application.\n\nTo apply formally, we ask that you send an email to gsoc@godotengine.org with:\n- A one-pager describing your technical proposal, why it would be a good fit for the engine and rough ideas on how it could be done\n- A (short) cover letter, describing why you would like to be a GSoC student at Godot\n- A résumé mentioning your current studies, and if applicable experience with free and open source software\n\nUPDATE: Note that you should also apply formally via the GSoC dashboard before March 27th! Sending an email to gsoc@godotengine.org is good as a notification and to get some early feedback, but the actual application should go through the interface.\n\nAs mentioned, you are really encourage to get in touch with Godot contributors before applying to put all chances on your side. We will not pre-approve proposals before a formal application following the GSoC timeline and rules, but we can give our assessment of the relevance of your ideas for the project, and their concordance with its philosophy and roadmap.

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

                "description": "The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.",

The implementation consists of an extra step, after the bug is found by the built-in solver (RangedConstraintManager) but before reporting it to the user; the path and the constraints that trigger the bug will be encoded in SMT and checked for satisfiability using the SMT solver Z3. The expected result of the project is to reduce the number of false bugs reported by the analyzer and evaluate the overhead introduced by Z3 during validation.",

                "description": "Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

Based on that, we will ask you a realistic planning for the 12 weeks of GSoC, including the deliverables expected at mid-term and at the end of the GSoC. In order to be complete, we also expect you to make a pull request, for example for a bug fix. The purpose is to ensure you know how to use Git, and that you had a look at our coding conventions.\n\nWe don't expect you to produce a perfect application without any help at all. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plans and your application with us while you're preparing it, to ensure your ideas align well with our own thoughts on the tasks, and that your objectives are achievable.

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

But the in-use implementation of Hadrian is still in development phase and not completely ready to be deployed. I believe that Hadrian will serve a huge assistance in increasing the productivity of Haskell developers. Therefore, the aim of my project will be to push Hadrian a few steps closer to deployment, so that the Haskell community can code with a bit more efficiency. \n\nA recent Pull Request by Alp Mestanogullary has implemented a basic rule for binary distribution. Also, I have been able to figure out multiple sources of errors causing validation failures, and my Pull Request has brought the number of failures down significantly. \n\nHence, the major goals of my project will be to:\n1) Achieve ghc-quake milestone that is listed in Hadrian.\n2) Implement missing features in Hadrian.\n3) Build a more comprehensive documentation of Hadrian.",

It is doing so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).\n\nDue to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.",

For all projects, we ask that you carefully read and follow the our [GSoC proposal template](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/GSoC-proposal-template).\n\nFor a project focused on a Classical language, it is a requirement that you have an intermediate-level knowledge of that language. If you do not know much about NLP, that is fine, the mentors can work with you on this. If you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what functionalities we have for various languages. \n\nFor those not familiar with an ancient language, we would like to see a web project that builds off the work (both in JavaScript) of two previous GSoC students. In 2016, a text reading environment was created. In 2017, a text-serving backend and annotation framework, both specifically build to handle the diverse conventions of pre-modern texts, were added to this reading environment. For 2018, we would like to see the work of the previous summers turned into fully abstracted and added as libraries into the npm registry.

Lemmatization is the process by which inflected word-forms are grouped together under their dictionary headings. This allows us to gather accurate word-usage statistics, analyze authorship, and model subject matter in classical corpora. However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.\n\nI propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship.",

                "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",

Members of such a stream will consent to terms of publishing their conversations online. Also this project will help search engines index public chats that happened on a Zulip server accessible to anyone on the web.

                "description": "# Why Oppia?\nOppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.\n\nAn enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.

            "abstract": "One of advantages of document-oriented databases like MongoDB or Couchbase over RDBMSs is an ability to change the data scheme easily, fast and often. The traditional approach in RDBMS world involves doing an expensive ALTER TABLE operation, slow upgrade of an existing data, and stuff like this. This approach is often slow and inconvenient for application developers.\nTo solve this issue PostgreSQL provides JSON and JSONB datatypes. Unfortunately JSONB has a disadvantage of storing all documents keys, which is a lot of redundant data.\nOne possibility to to reduce JSONB redundancy is to use zson extension. It compresses JSONB documents using shared dictionary of common strings that appear in all or most documents. This approach has its limitations though. Particularly, since data schema evolves, the dictionary has to be updated from time to time. Also zson can affect the build-in mechanism of PostgreSQL of compressing data using PGLZ algorithm since this mechanism uses some heuristics to recognize data that compresses well. Thus sometimes zson can reduce the overall performance.\nThe idea of this project is to create an extension that provides Thrift support which solves zson problem.",

PyNN is a Python package that offers a common interface for different neuronal simulators in the field. Tying all these together, a curated database of neuronal models is publicly available to the community at the Open Source Brain (OSB) repository.\n\nThis project focuses on the implementation of two Neural Mass Models (NMMs) using NeuroML/LEMS and PyNN. To validate and test the implementation of population models on NeuroML/LEMS, we will implement two previously published models and share them on the OSB platform.",

                "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2018-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea in our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us. Join our IRC channel #jpf on freenode to engage in a discussion about JPF.\n\nIn order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27).

It works fine but is not as hackable as we would like, and has poor integration with the rest of Guix. For instance, the daemon calls out to the 'guix substitute', 'guix authenticate', and 'guix offload' commands, but its interface to these commands is very limited. Furthermore, a large part of the daemon's code is already implemented in Scheme: container functionality is available with 'call-with-container', archive creation is implemented in (guix nar), writing derivation files (.drv) is done in (guix derivations), and so on.\n\nThe goal of this project would be to rewrite the daemon in Guile Scheme using the building blocks already available and also write the missing blocks in Guile Scheme. Important missing bits include the garbage collector and its scanner (which scans files for references to /gnu/store items), the scheduler, which schedules derivation builds in topological order, using the specified number of cores, etc.",

If you provide no mock-ups, schemas or supporting diagrams, you won't be accepted.\n\nAs part of applying for SoC we require that you take your idea and propose it to the MusicBrainz developer community. Please propose the idea and then respond to any  questions that may arise. Improve your proposal based on the feedback you receive from the community. If you cannot  get the community to support your idea your chances for getting your proposal accepted are very slim. Finally, in order to have your GSoC application be accepted by MetaBrainz you MUST interact with your potential mentor and submit one bug fix or new feature that is related to your proposal. You will need to create a schedule of how you plan to spend your time. A weekly breakdown with a few milestones is best.\n\nDo you have Github , Twitter or any other public profiles you think we might find interesting?\nHave you contributed to other Open Source projects or created projects on your own time? If so, which projects and can we see some of your code?\nDo you plan to have a job or study during the summer in conjunction with Summer of Code?",

This is not very slow but there are a lot of requests per page on AcousticBrainz and with the XML web service it takes very long time to retrieve. \n\nRecordings in AcousticBrainz are stored based on their MBID from MusicBrainz. As accessing the MusicBrainz data in AcousticBrainz takes a long time to retrieve using present web API, we should be having a tighter integration with MusicBrainz data so that we can access the data in a faster and more efficient manner.\n\nMy proposal involves working on accessing MB database in AB irrespective of the present web service. \nWith a direct access to MusicBrainz data, we can have a very tight integration with MusicBrainz database and can easily fetch MusicBrainz data and use it in many places in AcousticBrainz.",

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\n\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.",

Temperament refers to the process of altering the size of an interval by making it narrow or wide as compared to the pure form. Different types of temperament include equal, just intonation and meantone. Currently music blocks is limited to equal temperament only. This project aims to enhance the credibility of music blocks to all the three major types of tuning systems. Freeing Music Blocks from equal temperament will allow learners to understand music in more than one way. Above that the user can also create their own tuning system.",

That is, an image selected randomly from Commons, that matches the emoji.

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

In this project, AOM phase 1 & 2 is implemented.\n# phase 1\nThe accessibleNode property is added to DOM Element. The properties of AccessibleNode correspond to ARIA attributes one-to-one, and web browsers can modify accessibility tree via this property. Note that if both an AccessibileNode property and its corresponding ARIA attribute are present, the AccessibleNode property overrides the ARIA attribute.\n# phase 2\nAccessibleNode interface is derived from EventTarget so that accessibility input events and assistive actions become able to be processed via AccessibleNode. This enables web developers to check whether users are using an assistive technology or not, and this may leads to discrimination against some users. So, web browsers should ask users for permission of listening for accessiblity events before propagating those events to AccessibleNodes.",

The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called \"show\" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of \"tools\", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.",

This involves making a reader for ONNX models, and Keras models. I collaborated with the mentor, Mike Innes to work on this and the code can be found in the ONNX.jl repository under FluxML organization.\n\n# 2. Model Export : \nI will work on demos for the FluxJS.jl model zoo. This will make Machine Learning in Julia more dynamic and flexible, as it would help us in visualizing models in the browser. I'll also work on the main FluxJS package, as it still needs a lot of code tracing.\n\n# 3. Computer Vision :\n I propose to work on two different projects in this direction. The first project involves integrating Metalhead.jl with ONNX.jl . This will help in expanding the functionalities offered by Metalhead.jl. The second part of this project in loading and running Detectron model in Julia. Object detection has never been implemented in Julia before.

In my proposed approach, it's highly related with offline-SLAM.\n# Overview\nSparse online SLAM algorithms only produce sparse pointcloud, which is not ideal for the human. Surface reconstruction would produce more human-friendly maps. However, several issues need to be solved for performing surface reconstruction on real-time SLAM result. This includes globally optimize 3D points, enforcing smoothness,etc.\n\nBesides, it's possible to solve the problem via an offline-SLAM approach (with surface reconstruction), because it's highly related with that.\n# Specifications\nThe main part of this project is related to offline-SLAM, to compensate some trade-offs made by real-time SLAM for real-time consideration. This includes: \n- pose-graph optimization\n- bundle adjustment\n- enforcing smoothness\n- surface reconstruction\n- additional details about improving pointcloud accuracy\n\nThis project may combine several technicals used in state-of-art SLAM algorithm.\n# Realistic 3D maps\nRealistic 3D maps refer to maps with surface reconstruction (with color) so that they are more human-friendly.",

                "description": "__Description of the code__\n[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:\n- soft and rigid body dynamics,\n- heat transfer,\n- robotics\n- and visualization.\n\n![Modeling with SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SectionLiver-s.png)\n\n__1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse__\nThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library [Pulse](http://physiology.kitware.com/) platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.\n\n__2. Emscriptening Sofa__\nWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly. \n\n__3. Communication protocols in SOFA__\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA. \n\n__Contact__\n[Hugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation](https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/contact/)",

We recommend you to make at least one contribution to the project as that will help you to find out if this is the right project for you and to write a proposal, but you do **not** need to send a lot pull requests. The decision to select a student is made based on the proposal and not in the number of previous contributions. Remember that quality is more important than quantity!\n\n**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.\n\nWe recommend to read http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/",
