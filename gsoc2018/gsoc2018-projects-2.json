SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

                "description": "Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2001 to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.",

Identification of Gene Orthology Relation is the most important task of Comparative Genomics, as they tend to preserve similar molecular and biological functions. Thus if we can establish orthology relationships between two genes, we can obtain valuable evolutionary history of the two genes. However, with advanced sequencing depth and expansion in transcriptome data, genes are no longer the proper units for interrogation in functional conservation, evolutionary events, and expressional patterns, especially in the field of alternative splicing. As the accumulation of transcriptomic data, alternative splicing is taken into account in the assignments of gene orthologs and the orthology is suggested to be further considered at transcript level. Whether gene or transcript orthology, exons are the basic units that represent the whole gene structure; however, there is not much reported study on how to build exon level orthology in a whole genome scale. Therefore, it is essential to establish a transcription oriented gene orthology algorithm.",

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow. While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX.\n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale.

CiviCRM is web-based software used by a diverse range of organisations, particularly not-for-profit organizations (nonprofits and civic sector organizations). CiviCRM offers a complete feature set out of the box and can integrate with your website.\n\nCiviCRM is created and used by a global community of tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. Our vision is that 'all organisations – regardless of their size, budget, or focus – have access to an amazing CRM to engage their contacts and achieve their missions'. Our roadmap outlines the shorter term goals we are implementing to acheive our vision.\n\nAt the center of our community is a Core Team of staff that are employed to co-ordinate and provide leadership for the project, and to serve our users and service providers. Many of the organisations involved with CiviCRM choose to become members and partners with us. By doing so they help to secure our financial stability and their investment in CiviCRM - you can join them.\n\nThere are many different ways to get involved with CiviCRM. Our community guidelines aim to help people to get involved with our community, understand how we work together, and what we expect of each other.\n\nCiviCRM is released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (GNU AGPL v3).",

You'll need to register an account first at https://chat.civicrm.org/signup_email. Indicate you're interested in an existing project idea or that you have one of your own, or even that you just are interested in CiviCRM but none of the projects are quite right. \n\nPeople in the channel will help you create a good match between your interests and what would be a do-able project. This process will normally be a back and forth, with a project getting refined and changed from the original idea. We want to help you create as good a proposal as possible! \n\nWe may reach out into the community to find experts in the area of your interest, or user organizations with an interest in your proposal. At some point we'll likely have you setup a gitlab account (https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/gitlab-new-account.md)  and create an issue that will be a space where the project will be defined in more detail (see https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal). Then you'll submit the formal proposal to GSoC. \n\nStart early!",

We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning.\n\nSugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities. Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration.\n\n* Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write, share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.\n* Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.\n* Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.\n* The Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.\n* Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.\n* Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.\n* Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.\n* Sugar is largely written and maintained by its users.\n* Sugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.\n* Turtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser.",

The app will be focusing on kids who are non-readers and who are in the phase of developing their thinking, learning and collaborating abilities. The app will be made colorful so that it is fun & enjoyable for the kids. Sugarizer activities will include things like, learning about music, drawing shapes and learning basic mathematical concepts through games like Cuisenaire rods. Such activities will help kids learn counting, addition, subtraction in an engaging and fun-filled way. Existing educational apps available online are too difficult for kids & the smallness of the icons of existing apps makes it difficult for the kids to play. Hence, our application can address these shortcomings. The goal of Sugarizer Primero is to allow kids to use Sugarizer as a powerful learning tool. We will ensure that the graphics used in the user interface are bright and of a suitable size, so that it can attract kids attention.",

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft (eg. [HORIZONS](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [12 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And [more](http://openastronomy.org/members/)!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

                "description": "Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.",

[ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.",

                "description": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

This means that each student who wants to have chances to be picked for a LibreOffice project will need to build the whole application, fix a bug and submit the patch to the development mailing list.\n\nExplain what you want to achieve. Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.\n\nProblems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our [mentoring@documentfoundation.org](mailto:mentoring@documentfoundation.org) address.",

            "abstract": "In the recent years plenty of attention has been gathering around analyzing public sector texts via text mining methods enabled by modern libraries, algorithms and practices and bought to to the forefront by open source projects such as textblob, spaCy, SciPy, Tensorflow and NLTK. These collaborative productive efforts seem to be a shift towards more efficient understanding of natural language by machines which can be used in conjunction with public documents in order to provide a more robust organization and codification in the legal sector.  \nThis proposal  aims to extend the existing **Government Gazette (GG)** text mining code by implementing features in order to organize and (cross)-link GG texts with legal texts and detect the signatories via heuristic and machine learning methods. This will enable elimination of bureaucratic processes and huge time savings for jurists who for example seek legal documents in the **ISOKRATIS** database of legal texts.",

We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning.\n\nSugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities. Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration.\n\n* Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write, share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.\n* Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.\n* Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.\n* The Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.\n* Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.\n* Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.\n* Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.\n* Sugar is largely written and maintained by its users.\n* Sugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.\n* Turtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser.",

Also, GStreamer is withdrawing support from Python 2 very soon, as a consequence of which Sugar will no longer run on Debian, and soon, on Ubuntu. This project is critical for our viability and relevance. This project will also extend our product life on older systems used by schools\n\n### Schedule:\nA broad timeline would be to complete the in-progress port of Sugar Toolkit, Datastore and Artwork. After that, Sugar [core] will be ported and tested. I will complete this in the first 6 weeks of GSoC. After that, I will continue porting activities, starting with the set of Fructose, which are the core demonstration activities for Sugar. I will also write a script that will help developers continue porting activities to Python 3 easily. Once all this is complete, I will keep on porting more activities, if time permits.",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. \n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

The module should include a well documented API file that can be used by a wide variety of coders, especially those who come after you, and those who are not experts in your problem domain.\n\nYour project should be scaled to the appropriate level of ambition, so that at the end of the summer you have a working product.  Be realistic and honest with yourself about what you think you will be able to accomplish in the course of the summer.  Provide a detailed list of the steps you believe are needed, the tools you propose to use, and a weekly schedule of deliverables.  Clear and proper documentation can take much longer than expected.\n\nIf you are proposing a machine learning project, base the proposal on techniques that have already been successful in other similar projects.  Include as much information about previous research and results as possible.  Accuracy measurements will be required, and they should be as automated as possible.\n\nPlease be prepared to follow code formatting standards closely and to work with Singularity (virtual Linux system) images throughout the summer.",

                "description": "# A Scalable language\nScala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”",

Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.",

As a matter of fact, there are multiple trust-based extensions for well known protocold (e.g., AODV), but each one modifies in a particular way the single routing protocol, making it difficult to export the solution to other routing schemes.",

                "description": "__Description of the code__\n[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:\n- soft and rigid body dynamics,\n- heat transfer,\n- robotics\n- and visualization.\n\n![Modeling with SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SectionLiver-s.png)\n\n__1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse__\nThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library [Pulse](http://physiology.kitware.com/) platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.\n\n__2. Emscriptening Sofa__\nWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly. \n\n__3. Communication protocols in SOFA__\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA. \n\n__Contact__\n[Hugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation](https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/contact/)",

Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\nSpecific focus on personal computing\nCustom kernel designed for responsiveness\nFully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\nRich object-oriented API for faster development\nDatabase-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\nUnified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n==\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

                "description": "CERN-HSF (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

Since performing this change can significantly reduce the complexity of my main task, as well as any future extensions to the package, I plan to work on it during the first phase of the summer period. The first part of the present proposal goes through the necessary changes to achieve a clean API. The rest of the proposal iterates through the main modules that need to be ported into the GPU implementation. These are the different layer types that can be included in a convolutional neural network, as well as a number of generic helper functions. Attention is drawn on guaranteeing the deliverable's quality, both in terms of correctness and in terms of speed-up. This will be achieved through extensive testing and standardized benchmarking respectively.",

Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\nSpecific focus on personal computing\nCustom kernel designed for responsiveness\nFully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\nRich object-oriented API for faster development\nDatabase-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\nUnified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n==\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

The Haskell.org community is welcoming and happy to discuss these ideas with prospective students, via IRC or our mailing lists.\n\nEach project is labeled with its difficulty level, ranging from \"Beginner\", targeting newcomers, to \"Advanced\", better fitted for students who already have experience with Haskell. The exact prerequisites differ from project to project, thus it is suggested for students to contact their prospective mentor before submitting an application.\n\nFrom our side, when evaluating the student applications it is crucial that the applicant understands the problem and knows how to tackle it. Students should break down the project into smaller problems, assigning difficulty and time estimates to those sub-problems and explain how these sub-problems fit in the bigger picture of the project.\n\nWe also suggest adding some more information about the student's experience and education (if any), even if this relates to another programming language or technology.",

                "description": "CloudCV is an open source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of making AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n  \nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.",

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).",

It features a testsuite that aims to cover as many cases as possible in order to catch regressions.\n\nRadare2 is composed of a hexadecimal editor at its core, with support for several architectures and binary formats.

You can also choose any of the GitHub issues if they are big enough to be a qualification task, still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nSteps for the application process\n\n  - Read Google's instructions for participating\n  - Grab any project from the [list of ideas](http://radare.org/gsoc/2018/ideas.html) that you're interested in (or propose your own)\n  - Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing) and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you\n  - Submit it using Google's web interface\n\nHow to fill in the application template\n\n  - Keep it simple enough to fit on no more than a couple of pages. Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org. We are looking forwards to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating on something awesome together this summer.",

Good knowledge of the C programming language or assembler and a basic understanding of the git revision control system are required.\n\nWe expect students to pass a qualification task to get accepted. Passing this task will prove that you know how to program in C (or assembler), that you can handle git and - most importantly - that you are able to communicate with us on the mailing list and understand our sometimes complex review process.\n\nTherefore, it is important to get in touch with us as early as possible. Your qualification task is object to the very same review process like every other patch. Usually, many iterations are needed to make a patch acceptable which will take time.\n\n# Apply\n\nBest to prepare your proposal is to get to know our community and communication channels. Subscribe to our development mailing list and join #ffmpeg-devel on the freenode IRC network. You will already be able to gain a lot of insight about us, our rules and procedures by just following discussions on these channels.\n\nNext, write your potential mentor an initial mail to actually dive into your application. Be elaborative about yourself and your interest in the project so that your mentor can adapt to your capabilities in the best possible way. Your mentor will then guide you through your qualification task and possibly through all the rest of a successful Summer of Code.\n\n[Find all details in our Wiki](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2018)",

To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”",

                "description": "CCExtractor is originally an organization about subtitles and accessibility (our \"official\" description below). However, we're doing lots of other things that are related, including tinkering with open video hardware (JokerTV), imaging (OCR), and more. So we have projects that cover a range of interests, despite our core tool being the most amazing subtitle extractor.\n\nAnd now, the official description: Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

Also, the text localization algorithm gives terrible results in many cases due to inefficient detection of regions as text/non-text. The ticker text extraction feature must also be added to the current hardsubx system. There are some cases in which the DVB subtitle extraction gives poor results. \n\nThe goal of this project is to implement  a text localization and binarization pipeline which is independent of any input parameter(other than the video file). This localization algorithm would also improve the OCR results and the classification of the frames into text and non text regions would become efficient. This project also aims at adding tickertext extraction feature to the current hardsubx system. The DVB subtitle extraction causes noise to be generated on the text regions and an additional filtering step needs to be added to improve the results in the case of DVB subtitles too.",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\n\nSimplify complex log data\n\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\n\nDatabases destinations\n\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.\n\nMessage queue support\n\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\n\nSupport language bindings\n\nWant to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over [three hundred](https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. \n\nEclipse projects build technology in areas such as [Internet of Things](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), [Programming Languages and IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and [Runtimes](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and [EE4J](http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE).\n\nFor those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on [Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.\n\nYou've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...",

From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

            "abstract": "This project will explore extending a new feature for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). PCP is an open source framework at the system level that monitors, analyze and retrieve information to understand system performance. It has a distributed architecture of agents, called Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA), that extract performance values from the desired environments or systems.\n\nEvery agent (PMDA) reports to a centralized daemon called Performance Metric Collection Daemon or PMCD per host. Then, accessing any metric is as easy as sending a request to PMCDs. PCP has several client tools to help the final user understand the metrics. Finally, PCP also offers a good API to create an agent for any software.\n\nComing back to the interest of the proposal, PCP also supports instrumentation. This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA. In this scenario, Memory Mapped Values (MMV) are used to offer an extremely lightweight mechanism for instrumenting applications using shared memory. However, there is no support for metadata labels added since the newest v4, and hence the goal of this project: add label support for instrumentation.",

At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.\n\nJitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.",

Also The learning rate of spam classifier using Naïve Bayes as machine learning algorithm is low as it depends on probability model to learn.\nI’m proposing to build a statistical classifier plugin that will include various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with the focus being on neural nets, SVM(Support Vector Machines), HMM(Hidden Markov Model). \nThe user can activate any number of models of the plugin and overall filtering will be done based on the combined scores of the active models of this plugin.

                "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

An additional implementation exploits Kronecker structure in the \ncovariance matrix to obtain efficiency gains, but also only applies to\ndata observed with normally distributed noise.",

            "abstract": "DIPY is an open source software mainly focusing on diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis. For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.\n    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY.",

We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.\n\n# Improving Education with Innovative Technology\nQuill was recently featured in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and the [Google Machine Learning blog](https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/) for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers. \n\nLearners begin by completing a [diagnostic activity](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even [special versions of the diagnostic](https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692) for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)\n\nQuill has a variety of activity types, including [a real-time classroom lessons mode](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons), [a sentence construction tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [a proofreading practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) and [a grammar practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar).\n\nEach tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nUp until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.",

The advantages of the new JuliaDB/WebIO based approach are:\n\n- we can exploit JuliaDB's unique features, such as parallel storage and computing, support for online statistical techniques and machine learning techniques\n- WebIO allows deploying in a wide variety of frameworks: the Julia IDE Juno's plot pane, Jupyter notebook, an Electron window or a web page via Mux.jl\n\nThe web page deployment is particularly relevant in our view as it allows to make interactive data visualizations easily accessible online.\n\nFinally, rather than building a monolithic app, we will modularize our design to the extent possible, thus allowing different projects to reuse parts of it to create GUIs with different designs or based on different algorithms and visualization packages.",

Contact the Scilab GSoC mailing list if you have some questions on a subject (please, do not contact directly the mentor). We will update the corresponding wiki pages. Don't hesitate to do so. We do agree that some pages have too few information.\n 3. If needed, join us on IRC to get in touch with us and/or ask questions. Note that most of Scilab developers are in the France timezone (UTC+1)\n\n*If you need to get in touch with the potential mentor of a subject, drop an email to gsoc@lists.scilab.org*\n\nWe require students to build Scilab before submitting a project. It is easy to do. Students should send us a screenshot of the Scilab console with the updated banner containing his name. Building your own module (toolbox) is also appreciated, especially if it provides an actual feature (even a single function) and if it is integrated in ATOMS. Applicants providing patches fixing reported bugs (even easy one) will be considered with care. Applicants can also fix issues reported by Coverity.

The reasons for that approach are described in project proposal. \n\n\"*Redirection Mechanism for IKEv2*\" and \"*IKEv2 Session Resumption*\" are features that will improve the performance of VPN servers, especially the ones that serve a lot of VPN clients. \"*Group Key Managment using IKEv2*\" will enable key exchanging for secure Multicast communication.",

Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY), Rubex and tensorflow.rb [received it in 2016](https://goo.gl/QNiMq9) and RbCUDA in [2017](http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20171206).\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. In fact, all the grants issued by the Ruby Association (which is headed by Matz) in 2016 (and most in 2017)  have gone to scientific projects.\n\nSince we are first and foremost a science-related project, we expect successful student projects to lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.",

It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",

Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code.

                "description": "coala: Language Independent Code Analysis\n\ncoala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

Since all the major IDE's and code editors are now starting to support the standard Microsoft Language Server protocol it is now possible to expose coala's capabilities via the one said protocol and support a wide range of code editors. This proposal outlines the project where I intend to build one such server loosely based upon the proof of concept implementation built for vs-code. It should see noticeable performance improvements, feature upgrades to support actions such as didChange, didSave etc, customization of bears from within the LSP,  support for all languages coala supports and be a fully standards confirming general language server.",

                "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",

It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference.\n\nThe language natively supports lazy evaluation, and functions are generally not allowed to have side effects. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By not allowing side effects and dealing with immutable data, the compiler can avoid whole classes of bugs.\n\nHaskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.\n\nIn Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):\n\n- Compilers\n- Commonly used libraries\n- Commonly used applications written in Haskell\n- Profilers, debuggers and other tools\n- Package managers and infrastructure\n\nWe have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.",

Yet, contributions to the project ideas list is still open, inviting students to propose variations of the current ideas or a completely new project. The Haskell.org community is welcoming and happy to discuss these ideas with prospective students, via IRC or our mailing lists.\n\nEach project is labeled with its difficulty level, ranging from \"Beginner\", targeting newcomers, to \"Advanced\", better fitted for students who already have experience with Haskell. The exact prerequisites differ from project to project, thus it is suggested for students to contact their prospective mentor before submitting an application.\n\nFrom our side, when evaluating the student applications it is crucial that the applicant understands the problem and knows how to tackle it. Students should break down the project into smaller problems, assigning difficulty and time estimates to those sub-problems and explain how these sub-problems fit in the bigger picture of the project.\n\nWe also suggest adding some more information about the student's experience and education (if any), even if this relates to another programming language or technology.",

This makes Haddock generation a costly\noperation, and makes for a poor developer experience.\n\nAn equally long-standing suggestion to address this issue\nis to have GHC include enough information in the generated `.hi`\ninterface files in order to avoid Haddock having to duplicate that\nwork.

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

This web-based toolkit will also assist the configuration of the parameters that control individual signal processing routines thus making it easy to design complicated signal flows and execute them. The entire workflow will be exportable and reusable as a JSON file. The GUI will use the Java implementation in a way that the user will be free to implement his own methods and use them in the workflow designer. The GUI will host each signal processing method as a block and will allow users to draw data channels between them. This can then be directly be exported as a job to Spark.",

However an instant messaging client in a federated ecosystem like Jabber is only as good as the rest of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs good desktop clients, it needs good servers and good providers who maintain their servers and keep them up to date with the latest features. Conversations.im as an umbrella organization is about bringing improvements to that ecosystem. Partially by improving existing clients and servers but also by creating tools that aid server administrators to maintain their servers and that aid end users to pick a good, stable provider. Those tools include the XMPP Compliance Tester or the XMPP uptime monitor. We have a [collection of ideas](https://conversations.im/gsoc.html) that we think will improve the end user experience, but we are also very open to hearing other ideas that we didn’t think of ourself. Have you always thought about creating a service that will look up phone numbers and return Jabber IDs or otherwise improve the discoverable of contacts? Great. Let us hear your ideas and we might be able to find a suitable mentor for you. Want to add a new feature to an existing client? Great we will put you in touch with the appropriate mentors. Want to start developing your own client? Probably not a very good idea since every platform already has a client that awaits your help.",

For startes we recommend creating an account on the conversations.im server. In both Gajim and Conversations you can tick the checkbox Create new account during initial setup.\n\nAfter downloading a client and creating an account please join the conversations group chat (MUC) under the address: xmpp:gsoc@conference.conversations.im?join.\n\nDetails on what we expect the actual proposal to look like can be found at the bottom of our [ideas page](https://conversations.im/gsoc.html).\n\nPlease note that those ideas are only inspirations. You can submit any project proposal that you believe will bring value to the XMPP ecosystem. Be it tools that help server admins create better servers, add a specific feature to a specific XMPP server or client or tools that somehow improve the usability for end users. In a way we even appreciate it even more if you submit your own ideas instead of copy pasting one of ours because it shows that you have investment in the XMPP ecosystem.",

To ensure that it's relevant, discuss it with Godot developers and use their feedback to write your application.\n\nTo apply formally, we ask that you send an email to gsoc@godotengine.org with:\n- A one-pager describing your technical proposal, why it would be a good fit for the engine and rough ideas on how it could be done\n- A (short) cover letter, describing why you would like to be a GSoC student at Godot\n- A résumé mentioning your current studies, and if applicable experience with free and open source software\n\nUPDATE: Note that you should also apply formally via the GSoC dashboard before March 27th! Sending an email to gsoc@godotengine.org is good as a notification and to get some early feedback, but the actual application should go through the interface.\n\nAs mentioned, you are really encourage to get in touch with Godot contributors before applying to put all chances on your side. We will not pre-approve proposals before a formal application following the GSoC timeline and rules, but we can give our assessment of the relevance of your ideas for the project, and their concordance with its philosophy and roadmap.

The WebRTC standard will be able to provide support to Godot's existing multiplayer in making these sorts of peer-to-peer games.   \n   \nIt will also make multiplayer viable in the HTML5 target platform, and allow for easy interfacing with non-Godot peers that use WebRTC.  Additionally, the support I build for WebRTC will make it easy to later add WebRTC MediaStreams, allowing for in-game voice chat.

Our web-based data browser helps scientists make inferences and test hypotheses. Unique and important in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to combine their private data securely with public data using a decoupled server-client architecture. We are funded for the next 5 years by the National Cancer Institute as a genomic data visualization center to develop tools to visualize the largest compendium of cancer genomics data, the Genomic Data Commons. While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users. We are committed to open-source software from the beginning and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our [static interval tree](http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree), [KM statistics](http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier) and [ICGC plugin](http://xena.ucsc.edu/integration-icgc-portal/)). \n\nStudents we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger [UCSC Genomics Institute]( https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease. We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project. \n\nWe are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genetics, statistics, data visualization, database query, or functional programing, please contact us as soon as possible. We want to help all students submit the best possible proposal.",

Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\nSpecific focus on personal computing\nCustom kernel designed for responsiveness\nFully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\nRich object-oriented API for faster development\nDatabase-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\nUnified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n==\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

The latter phase requires full understanding of how Groups and Loans functions on Mifos X and detailed knowledge of the Apache Fineract CN to replicate some of the Group features such as Joint Group Loan Management and Joint Liability Group within the context of Apache Fineract CN which I am committed to do. Beside the 21 hours of school classes every week, i will dedicate the rest of my time and my weekends to learning and implementing this project and will continue contributing to the community after this summer period.",

Basically when facing situations similar to what we have encountered before. This phenomenon signalled the development of many mathematical models of similarity.\n\nMetric learning is one amongst those models that perform the task of devising similarities over objects. It has a plethora of applications in fields like information retrieval and recommendation system. Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised techniques such as clustering, supervised procedures like KNN classification and semi-supervised modes as well. Metric learning has been involved as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches.\n\nHenceforth learning a neat distance metric is a crucial task for forming similarities. LMNN & BoostMetric are among the supervised distance metric learning techniques which excel in this task. Accordingly, the fundamental objective of this project is to code novel implementations of LMNN & BoostMetric, with the purpose of achieving better benchmarking over kNN classification.",

We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

As an additional task, the work on visual comparison tool is planned to be started, though it will not be finished during this summer. For implementation of these tasks some changes will be made to MSCX file format which is one of the formats used by MuseScore for saving music scores. This format will be optimized for suitability for textual comparison purpose which will allow to benefit from well-established robust textual comparison tools for implementation of the score comparison tools mentioned above.",

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).",

When we translate a format which does not include 3-D coordinate information into a format which requires it, we must predict coordinates. Open Babel implements a rule-based coordinate prediction method, but the current implementation is problematic. It sometime fails when we treat inorganic and organometallic molecules, and by relying on force field geometry optimization, it is slower than distance-geometry or fragment-based methods.\n\nThis is a proposal to implement a fast and efficient method to calculate 3-D coordinates using fragment information. Since fragments can decide the position of many atoms at once and minimize the need for conformer sampling, this approach is more efficient. [P. Baldi's paper in 2013](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci4005282) reports that their fragment-based method is more accurate and 10 times faster than Open Babel. Implementing a better prediction method is beneficial for chemistry and leads to new discoveries in the field of drug design.",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.\n\n### The lab\nThe Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <https://lab.open-roberta.org/> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.\n\nThe backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:\n* EV3 LEGO Mindstorms \n* NXT LEGO Mindstorms\n* BBC micro:bit \n* Calliope mini\n* Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based\n* NAO, a humanoide robot\n* Bob3\n\n### Outlook\nWhile the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.",

                "description": "The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system.\r\n\r\n Debian GNU/Linux is:\r\n\r\n* Full featured: Users can select which packages to install; Debian provides a tool for this purpose. You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.",

These collaborations are often based on industry trends that require collaborative development of solutions for increased functionality in automobiles.  GENIVI has become a community where ecosystems outside of the automotive industry can meet and leverage the global automaker and supplier network in the GENIVI membership.\n\nGENIVI is accelerating innovation within the automotive ecosystem and driving initiatives founded on leading trends including system on a chip (SOC) consolidation, advanced user interfaces, software-over-the-air (SOTA), car-to-cloud connectivity and entertainment in autonomous vehicles. \n\nAn example of automotive trends meeting open technology is the GENIVI Vehicle Domain Interaction Strategy. GENIVI, in collaboration with other global technology providers, is developing open standard interfaces and code that bridge multiple car software domains. \n\nGENIVI has also delivered multiple software components that have been adopted and deployed in production vehicles worldwide.  Developed by GENIVI, several standard interfaces (APIs) have been adopted in many commercial and open source solutions.  These software components and interfaces are combined into a buildable baseline (based on Yocto Project’s meta-ivi layer) as well.  This baseline is the basis of the GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) that is an open source, automotive development platform where prototypes and innovative IVI and connected vehicle solutions can be rapidly developed and tested.",

This project aims at porting it to FreeBSD in order to make it easier and faster for Windows Server professionals to start working on FreeBSD server workloads and to make available yet another shell choice which is friendly for new-coming Windows users. In order to achieve that, however, porting the .NET Core SDK toolchain, including CoreCLR, CoreFX and the CLI itself, is necessary once they are vital PowerShell dependencies. As a result, FreeBSD users should have access to PowerShell, an object-oriented shell to interact with the system, and .NET Core, which can be useful for developers to build and run their applications on FreeBSD personal and server machines.",

                "description": "Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

The gentoo-soc mailing list, the gentoo-soc IRC channel or any of the listed mentors can provide feedback.\n\nWrite a proposal attempting to convince us why your project should be chosen. A few sentences are not sufficient in most cases to sway anyone.\n\nAbstract. Try to keep this section in one paragraph. It should not be an in depth analysis.\n\nObjective. What problem does the project solve? This does not need to be a long section.\n\nDeliverables. What will the project consist of when it is finished? Source code, documentation, a build system, libraries, binaries. These should all be enumerated and described in details in your proposal.\n\nTimeline. When will the deliverables be done? This section needs to be chronologically and technically detailed.\n\nBiography. Tell us about yourself.\n\nWe highly recommend having some initial discussion with one of the mentors about your proposal before you submit it.\n\nMore information at: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2018/Application_Guidelines",

Multiple basic analysis functions like Radial Distribution Function, Contact Matrices, depepend very heavily on fast distance evaluations. \nApart from naive approach for pairwise calculations which scale as O(N^2), other forms of data structures like KDTree, Octree are sugested for faster calulations based on the requirements. Based on the MDAnalysis, two use cases are identified as highly used in majority of the analysis algorithms. \nThe goal of the project is to identify the data structure based on the requirements of the use case and implement in the MDAnalysis library along with clear documentations and test cases.",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

CERNBox is based on ownCloud, a cloud sync and share platform written in PHP following a Model-View-Controller architecture software pattern.\n\nThis project aims to provide a prototype of a new web UI for CERNBox that will provide an immersive user experience. To achieve this, a milestone of this project is to provide offline manipulation of the data from the browser. The use case is that when a user goes offline in his browser, he could continue to work on the document and perform actions like renaming and browsing his files.  Once network is re-established, the application will reconcile the changes in the browser cache with the server, offering a non-disruptive work environment for the end-user.",

CROSS turns OSS prototypes into successful open source software projects. The Center was created in 2015 inspired by the story of UCSC alumni (and CROSS benefactor) Sage Weil, who turned his research prototype into a multi-million dollar company.  We draw from this expertise of our affiliated experts and industry members to choose projects that will have maximum real world impact. Our projects--which typically center around the work of senior graduate students and post-docs-- are mentored and guided by a team of experts chosen specifically to best ensure success.\n\nCROSS uses a combination of teaching, networking, research and incubation of open source projects. Our industry members include Micron, Huawei, Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. CROSS \ncurrently supports seven open source software projects-- three research projects and two incubator projects. \n\nThese projects currently include:\n- ZLog: Distributed Shared-log for Software-defined Storage (Research)\n- Smart Storage Devices in Genomics (Research)\n- Mantle: A Programmable Metadata Load Balancer for the Ceph File System (Research)\n- Strong Consistency in Dynamic Wireless Networks to Enable Safe and Efficient Navigation of Autonomous Vehicles (Research)\n- An Efficient C Library for Unum 2.0 (Research)\n- Skyhoook: Elastic Databases for the Cloud (Incubator) \n- The NIMBLE environment for statistical computing (Incubator)",

                "description": "Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”",

                "description": "The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.\n\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

While we do this, it is imperative that these embeddings are able to accommodate the semantic relatedness between entities. This means that we are not limiting ourselves with just the similarity between words, instead we take a step further ahead to also define the relatedness between the vectors and thus the relation between the entities and the text. Therefore, to incorporate this measure of the semantic distance, we define a measure of descriptiveness of the class that these entities belong to. Entities belonging to a class that has a very high level of description must have very low semantic distance in our model. Eventually, we extend the usability by predicting embeddings for out-of-vocabulary entities as well, and also extract relations between those entities using approaches that have been previously used for link prediction tasks in machine learning.",

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

However, a wide range of modern N-body hydrodynamics simulations now use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) which produces data consisting of volume filling fields. The current implementation of yt takes this data fills a global octtree, and then treats it similarly to that of AMR data.\n\nThe disadvantage of this treatment of SPH data is that it is not intuitive to users, it is slow and it does not represent the underlying nature of the data.\n\nThis project aims to develop a yt API for SPH data that ensures all SPH fields return data defined at the locations of the particles. Whilst this would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the data, it is still important to interpolate particle data onto grids, as this is essential in visualisation. This can be achieved by taking inspiration from SPLASH. Thus, at the end of the project SPH fields would be able to be visualised using a \"scatter\" (in technical details) approach, inspired by SPLASH. This would allow the the SPH fields to be interpolated efficiently onto grids.",

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent\nsoftware. It is written in C++, Python and JavaScript, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE\ncommunication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor\nor the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.\n\nJdeRobot include many tools: (a) JdeRobot-Academy, a suite for teaching robotics and computer vision, with 20 motivating exercises; (b) VisualStates, for visual creation of automata that control robot behavior; (c) Scratch2JdeRobot, for programming advanced robots with a full visual language; (d) robot teleoperators, even with web technologies; (e) a tuner for color filters, etc.",

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

                "description": "Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.\n\nJitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.",

Final transcript is also sent as plain text after the meet is over.\n\n## Proposed Translation Layer\n- A translation service(`translate.js`) will be built in lib-jitsi-meet i.e will run on the client side of the application which will initially make use of `Microsoft Translate Text API` will use the JSON messages received and provide accurate translation in real time. This will be sent back to `Chatroom.js` to send translated text to the MUC.\n- UI for the settings panel required in the front-end part of the application will be developed and integrated by working with the `React` components. Subtitles with acceptable delay will also be seen here.\n- A mechanism for delivering final transcript will be developed by storing the intermediate translated text and rendering once a meet gets over.",

                "description": "Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n# Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

You are free to propose an entirely original project or to pick ideas from our GSOC page: \n\nhttps://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC \n\nThe proposal should also include rough weekly goals and broader milestone goals coinciding with the three evaluation phases. We expect inline documentation and javadocs throughout the project, but please notice that wrapping things up and adding \"the final touches\" at the end of the project takes time.\n\nFinally, the proposal should include details about your experience/interests in relation to the GSOC project, but we'd prefer if you didn't include details such as photos, gender, age and other personal details that have no relevance to the project. Full resumes are also not useful.\n\nExpect to stay in daily contact with the project during the work period.

                "description": "Rocket.Chat is one of the largest active open source (permissive MIT source license) nodeJS communications platform communities on GitHub, featuring 600+ global community contributors (across projects) from 30+ countries, 15780+ GitHub stars, 3300 forks, 140+  total releases and 6,200+  issues since inception in 2015.\n\nIn a world where communication platforms are almost all totally proprietary, privacy-infringing, and centralized (Skype, Slack, WhatsApp, and so on). Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

                "description": "The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

                "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.\n\n# Usage\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.",

                "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

                "description": "CERN-HSF (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

Often, a lot of time is spent in setting up new sites with significant inputs from teams at CERN and at the organization operating the site. Lightweight Sites abstracts away and consolidates resources to aid the setup. To achieve this, a Lightweight Sites Specification document has been created that will allow the software configuration of the entire site through a central module. This would be the Level 1 configuration. In addition, other Lightweight Sites Components would be created according to specifications. One such component includes the repositories for containers of different compute elements (CE), batch systems, worker nodes (WN), etc. These containers are also configured and comprise the Level 2 configurations. In the past, YAIM, an in-house configuration tool has been used for Level 2 configurations. In this project, in addition to setting up Level 1 configuration, popular configuration tools like Ansible and Puppet would be used for Level 2 configuration, replacing YAIM. This migration would contribute to the project by making it easier to configure new Lightweight Sites.",

CiviCRM is web-based software used by a diverse range of organisations, particularly not-for-profit organizations (nonprofits and civic sector organizations). CiviCRM offers a complete feature set out of the box and can integrate with your website.\n\nCiviCRM is created and used by a global community of tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. Our vision is that 'all organisations – regardless of their size, budget, or focus – have access to an amazing CRM to engage their contacts and achieve their missions'. Our roadmap outlines the shorter term goals we are implementing to acheive our vision.\n\nAt the center of our community is a Core Team of staff that are employed to co-ordinate and provide leadership for the project, and to serve our users and service providers. Many of the organisations involved with CiviCRM choose to become members and partners with us. By doing so they help to secure our financial stability and their investment in CiviCRM - you can join them.\n\nThere are many different ways to get involved with CiviCRM. Our community guidelines aim to help people to get involved with our community, understand how we work together, and what we expect of each other.\n\nCiviCRM is released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (GNU AGPL v3).",

Indicate you're interested in an existing project idea or that you have one of your own, or even that you just are interested in CiviCRM but none of the projects are quite right. \n\nPeople in the channel will help you create a good match between your interests and what would be a do-able project. This process will normally be a back and forth, with a project getting refined and changed from the original idea. We want to help you create as good a proposal as possible! \n\nWe may reach out into the community to find experts in the area of your interest, or user organizations with an interest in your proposal. At some point we'll likely have you setup a gitlab account (https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/gitlab-new-account.md)  and create an issue that will be a space where the project will be defined in more detail (see https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

                "description": "Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).",

A LTO object file contains various sections for storing command line options, symbol table, global declarations and types, function bodies in GIMPLE, ipa pass summaries, ipa references, static variable initializers and the call graph.\nThere are couple of limitations of the byte code format:\n1] It is not self descriptive, which makes it harder to debug.\n2] The byte code is essentially a “serialized” version of in-memory representations, which makes it prone to break across versions.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to create a dump tool for easily analyzing LTO object files similar to readelf or objdump -d for regular ELF object files.",

                "description": "CERN-HSF (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

The bug report (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91562 ) now has more than 700 votes. The most efficient face recognition algorithm in digiKam is FaceNet which is implemented using neural networks. However, the speed of the algorithm is not as fast as the same implementation in dlib. One sufficient reason is that the code borrowed from dlib is not complete which makes the algorithm slow. The goal of this project consists of two parts: First, rearrange the sorting of items in the icon view by drag and drop. This sort must be stored in the database and must be retrievable like the other sort functions. Second, include dlib in digiKam source tree, and rewrite the code of face recognition using dlib in order to speed up the algorithm.",

In this scenario, a GUI based software that provides an easy way to get people started with encrypting personal data, messages, is an important step - and I hope this project helps accomplish that.\nAs a shocking example - I recently travelled with a railway staff who was travelling roughly 900 miles just to deliver a letter from the Railway head office of India to a remote location office (on enquiry- ‘it could not go as a soft copy simply because it was confidential and required the “signature” of some senior officer as authentication’).",

X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",

Recently the amdgpu’s (AMD’s graphics driver) scheduler was shifted to a common space (now called DRM GPU scheduler) so that the other drivers can reuse the code. The GPU scheduler is now used by amdgpu and etnaviv (graphics driver for Vivante GPUs). It provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs into queues which are then executed by a hardware run queue. Now amdgpu has multiple identical hardware queues and we currently map round robin to the software queues provided by the GPU scheduler when those are created. To better balance the load we could extend the scheduler to feed multiple hardware queues from just one software queue provided by the GPU scheduler.",

                "description": "Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”",

                "description": "Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.",

So we have projects that cover a range of interests, despite our core tool being the most amazing subtitle extractor.\n\nAnd now, the official description: Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

Once there is reasonable level of confidence in the correctness of the model, the task that remains is to estimate the parameters of the model. Due to the structure of parameter estimation problems in dynamical models, statistics and machine learning techniques are an ideal choice for determining the parameters. During the course of the summer I will be implementing some statistical algorithms, including Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization(SAEM) and Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP), for parameter estimation of a dynamic model. I will also work on extending support for parameter estimation in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) by adding first differences distribution to generalized Log-Likelihood. These would be quite important additions to the suite of methods in JuliaDiffEq and would be of great use to scientific community involved in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study, and drug dosage estimation.",

Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code.

                "description": "**webpack is a module bundler**. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n## Overview\n\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM). \n\n## What makes webpack unique?\n\n**Extensibility** webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system. \n\n**Focused around Web Performance** webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\n**Built in JavaScript** webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve. \n\n**Used at Scale** webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\n**Community Owned** webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling",

CMS is a PHP based application that powers about 3.2% of the web, 6.5% of all CMS based websites, as well as many intranets.\n* The Joomla Framework is a PHP application framework used for building web and command line applications, and is the basis of the Joomla CMS.\n\nEach of these projects has hundreds of contributors, a set of working groups and teams, and a leadership group. These are coordinated by the [Production Department](https://volunteers.joomla.org/departments/production/ \"Joomla Production Department\"). This is an umbrella application for the two projects.\n\nThe Joomla CMS and Joomla Framework are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.\n\nThe Joomla Project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together. The [mission, vision and values](https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/mission-vision-and-values.html \"Joomla Mission vision and values\") of the Joomla Project reflect this. \n\nThe official sponsoring organisation is Open Source Matters (OSM), the not for profit organization that manages financial and legal issues for the Joomla Project. A team of experienced people drawn from many areas of the project will manage the 2018 GSoC project for Joomla.",

                "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html#get-started).",

It is doing so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).\n\nDue to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.",

For all projects, we ask that you carefully read and follow the our [GSoC proposal template](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/GSoC-proposal-template).\n\nFor a project focused on a Classical language, it is a requirement that you have an intermediate-level knowledge of that language. If you do not know much about NLP, that is fine, the mentors can work with you on this. If you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what functionalities we have for various languages. \n\nFor those not familiar with an ancient language, we would like to see a web project that builds off the work (both in JavaScript) of two previous GSoC students. In 2016, a text reading environment was created. In 2017, a text-serving backend and annotation framework, both specifically build to handle the diverse conventions of pre-modern texts, were added to this reading environment. For 2018, we would like to see the work of the previous summers turned into fully abstracted and added as libraries into the npm registry. See the Project ideas page for full technical details.\n\nIf you are unsure of how to contribute, please reach out to us on Gitter or Google Groups.",

Also, irrational numbers representation as the number π or e^π are not handled by the native number data types and causing limitations when calculations are based on those numbers. The problem can be summarized as: there are an infinite amount of different numbers and a finite representation system. Even if there are some existing solutions, there is not a modern C++ open source library to attack the problem and Boost C++ could be the appropriated place.\n\nFollowing the Real number representation introduced in chapter 2 of Oliver Aberth. Computable Calculus. Academic Press, 2001. I propose to implement a data type to represent Real numbers and to define the operators (+, -, *, /, !=, <, >, =). This data type attacks the introduced problem and allows to represent some calculable real numbers as π",

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",
