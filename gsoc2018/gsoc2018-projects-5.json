We release open source clients, SDKs, servers and bridges as well as maintain the spec!","description":"### What is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n### What is Matrix’s Mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n### What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n### How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nRecent work on Matrix includes [E2E encryption](https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/) (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), [embeddable widgets](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), [Communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)!\n\n* [Encrypting Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/)\n* [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lj4cCPcRF75WxmtxvnsuTVQ9DqfoGWVHiUuVgV_RIQ11qa4xywfxjEjHxNimWmRkdWYp6HI-CG-kDXcvunZ5ARgRHP1xgg","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/@matrixdotorg","blog_url":"https://matrix.org/blog","application_instructions":"In order to apply to Matrix, students should first get to know the project and community by browsing [the Matrix Specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec) and launching a Matrix client and joining the [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org) chatroom.  Students may also wish to hang out in #matrix:matrix.org or #matrix-dev:matrix.org to better understand the project.\n\nA good next starting point is to play with the Matrix API to send and perhaps receive some instant messages - or experiment with some of the more unusual Matrix clients which are currently in development.  Another good bet would be to try installing a Matrix homeserver (e.g. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) to get a feeling for the technology involved.\n\nWe then suggest thoroughly reading through our [GSoC Ideas List](https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md) and asking questions on #gsoc:matrix.org about the items which interest you.

Both tools have problems showing errors from background process because most of the commands run as a process wrapper.\nThe objective of this project would be to combine both of the GUI web apps features in to one and give more productive single GUI.","assignee_display_names":["Chris Mattmann"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5950027143315456,"title":"Slic3r - Rotating Face to Bottom","subcategory":"slic3r","organization":{"id":5240726938451968,"name":"BRL-CAD","slug":"brl-cad","website_url":"https://brlcad.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"devs@brlcad.org","mailing_list":"http://brlcad.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists","irc_channel":"https://brlcad.zulipchat.com","tagline":"Solid modeling, 3D printing, comp. graphics, & other computer-aided tech (CAx)!","precis":"BRL-CAD is partnered with several computer-aided technologies (CAx) including LibreCAD, OpenSCAD, STEPcode, LinuxCNC, FreeCAD, & Slic3r.

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats.

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kWqF0bT_hHDVRLhg2pJhsFghmGZEWTTIqBSe5XOZKNDMyObRv__UjSH8d-Sf6eqvBxglXqtAD3u93Qzgqbv9vz4B_0-IXJo","image_bg_color":"000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

These aren't just bug-finding tools.  Our tools give a guarantee, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

Major users of such data are fishermen or sailors. They need to know the positions of dangerous storms, hurricanes etc and allow them to move away from them. Generally, the weather images can be downloaded from the internet, but the ships rarely have an internet connection. Hence for this, one of the solutions is that NOAA weather satellites freely send the weather images and data down to earth continuously. This is perfect for us, the users can simply have a simple and cheap RTL-SDR device and capture this freely available weather data. Currently, this is possible, but there are no opensource tools that come with the complete package. Usually, one software is used to capture and demodulate FM and then the decoded audio is fed into the other software to decode the image. This complex procedure needs a human's manual input and the raw IQ file may be lost in the process. This project intends to solve this. The open source tool that will be developed will have all the required functionalities.","assignee_display_names":["Kai Wilke","Hornig","AerospaceResearch.net","tensai"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5974936611454976,"title":"Packaging and Updating Android SDK Tools","subcategory":"android","organization":{"id":5166394929315840,"name":"Debian Project","slug":"debian-project","website_url":"https://debian.org","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"debian-outreach@lists.debian.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-outreach/","irc_channel":"https://wiki.debian.org/IRC","tagline":"the universal operating system","precis":"Debian is the free operating system, based on the GNU/Linux kernel.

The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built.

Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/4MDzw_NjNaZ5AM-CCoMRmYEQSaGNCoBsTrlYnZLM3w7QNv9s29jkgeEwwpRD4ZNgH7RF6u4BtcxFlgJq6NG_SgGGJ8-ugQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"https://planet.FreeBSD.org/","application_instructions":"Please look at our [instructions for applying with FreeBSD](https://gsoc.FreeBSD.org/) which includes lots of details on producing a good proposal that stands a better chance of being accepted.

The goal of the project is to convert all the PCI drivers attachments to be table driven and mark with PNP_INFO. \nThe devmatch infrastructure gives us a way to match up hardware with kernel modules that implement drivers that claim the hardware. The problem is that the drivers need some modification before devmatch can use them. Specifically, they need to have their device ID scans done via a table, and that table needs to be decorated with a PNP_INFO tag so the compiler and kld_xref extract the metadata that devmatch needs to do this job. As the PCI drivers are all over the place in terms of how they match device IDs work will be needed to move some of the in-line code to tables, some of the tables lookups may be able to move to standardized routines, etc. Trimming GENERIC to show that the drivers work is also required.\nThere are about 243 such PCI drivers. grep -r 'DRIVER_MODULE.*, pci,' * | wc is used to find out. The plan is to convert a significant portion of them and maintain a documentation of the conversion.","assignee_display_names":["Chuck Tuffli","Warner Losh"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5982183362134016,"title":"ElasticSearch destination: native(C) REST API","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":4514364854370304,"name":"The syslog-ng project.","slug":"syslog-ng","website_url":"https://syslog-ng.org/","category":"security","contact_email":"syslog-ng@lists.balabit.hu","mailing_list":"https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/syslog-ng","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/balabit/syslog-ng","tagline":"Open source log management solution with over a million users worldwide.","precis":"With syslog-ng, you can collect logs from any source, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.","description":"Why syslog-ng?\n\nWith syslog-ng, you can collect logs from wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.\n\nsyslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.\n\nBy integrating with the newest big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to kafka and elasticsearch, even store logs in hdfs with high performance.\n\nSupport for common inputs\n\nsyslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.\n\nFlexible data extraction\n\nWorking with unstructured data?

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.

These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind.

FFmpeg reverse engineered Cineform decoder currently supports progressive video files with image formats YUV 4:2:2 10-bit, RGB and RGBA 4:4:4 12-bit.  This project aims to support more features present in cineform codec, namely Inverse Temporal Transform for p-frames, deinterlacing support, assembly instructions integration into the ffmpeg version, and making it faster by using threading models present in FFmpeg. The result of this project will be that Cineform decoder can be integrated with many tools that use FFmpeg libav.","assignee_display_names":["kierank"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6036081242275840,"title":"Create Custom Lists.","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5049403694383104,"name":"WorldBrain.io - Verifying the Internet","slug":"worldbrainio-verifying-the-internet","website_url":"http://worldbrain.io","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"gsoc@worldbrain.io","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"http://join-worldbrain.herokuapp.com","tagline":"Bookmarking extension that works like your brain - full-text search everything.","precis":"WorldBrain Memex - a bookmarking extension that works like your brain.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/EJ7vLvAQgTYtEf213LNLThezRCTdu8dPMY2n5X9I_1kNMQdV9pfz9D_GBk1dTv3RSiOsEo6KmKnRbnf1wNMOW3hsAnQ4Og","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"https://blog.openmrs.org/","application_instructions":"Students interested in applying to GSoC 2018 to work on an OpenMRS project are asked to complete a Google Summer of Code 2018 application and provide the following information:\n# Who are you?

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind.

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xbNNxmOK9vsF1Nh34aDV_VJQHzEOSgCleG99BfkwL48oanpg9NFAiPxkEUp_j19nryhNnU_EgvRv02R1AcLeHNLg6IHEFic","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/@processingorg","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

A layout created for a particular version of a graph may not be compatible with other versions of the same graph, therefore a feature will be added to check layout compatibility and to transfer layout between different versions of a graph.","assignee_display_names":["Aditya Bharadwaj","Jing Cui"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6072759591895040,"title":"Android SDK Tools in Debian","subcategory":"android","organization":{"id":5166394929315840,"name":"Debian Project","slug":"debian-project","website_url":"https://debian.org","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"debian-outreach@lists.debian.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-outreach/","irc_channel":"https://wiki.debian.org/IRC","tagline":"the universal operating system","precis":"Debian is the free operating system, based on the GNU/Linux kernel.

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jC07WJ0bFpZFV_QcSPsLCqV_qG0TYR1dHi_Zk9ZV6usiie35fQqXd2YQk3A0mZ53S3mGs0uXh6KbwcxKj0QuCD83UIGGag","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/debian","blog_url":"https://planet.debian.org/","application_instructions":"Individual projects are highlighted on the [projects list](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects).

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kWqF0bT_hHDVRLhg2pJhsFghmGZEWTTIqBSe5XOZKNDMyObRv__UjSH8d-Sf6eqvBxglXqtAD3u93Qzgqbv9vz4B_0-IXJo","image_bg_color":"000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

Students should break down the project into smaller problems, assigning difficulty and time estimates to those sub-problems and explain how these sub-problems fit in the bigger picture of the project.\n\nWe also suggest adding some more information about the student's experience and education (if any), even if this relates to another programming language or technology.","topic_tags":["functional-programming","programming languages"],"technology_tags":["haskell"],"proposal_tags":["haskell","compilers","libraries","package managers","functional programming","cabal","yaml","codeworld","graphs","ghc"],"ideas_list":"https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html","contact_method":"committee@haskell.org","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":5359954471419904,"display_name":"Shayan Najd","program_year":2018},"abstract":"The goal is to continue on an ongoing work, utilising the Trees that Grow technique, to introduce native-metaprogramming in GHC.\nNative-metaprogramming is a form of metaprogramming where a metalanguage's own infrastructure is directly employed to generate and manipulate object programs.\nIt begins by creating a single abstract syntax tree (AST) which can serve a purpose similar to what is currently served by Template Haskell (TH), and the front-end AST inside GHC (HsSyn).

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

Currently `solveset` is unable to handle such equations, therefore, to make `solveset` powerful and versatile `transolve` needs to be implemented. `transolve` will mainly cover equations like logarithmic, exponential, equations solvable by LambertW and trigonometric. Apart from this `solveset` also needs to give a unified result for a union of `ImageSet`, and that is why `_union()` in `ImageSet` also needs to be implemented.

This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\n\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PxFw8wDQUkPqz5ZVyRaSbNAqQpEotHzm-9_2nsRtf1UpUkX_-UqfAUvmmvVwekrFUrrPbEsPjzFhAwAugQG4EpxwS5WAkA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"(Also available here: https://goo.gl/sR2tnN)\n\nWe would like to know who you are and how you think.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":4700038450642944,"display_name":"Vaibhav Kumar Rai","program_year":2018},"abstract":"# Debug and Profile Bears\n\nThe aim of this project is to create a  better quality Bears by creating a tool which will have the ability to jump directly into Bear code and move through it using a debugger interface such as pdb and make debugging of Bears as easy as writing the Bear.\n\nA Debugger should also the ability to investigate the settings passed to the Bear and inspect the results created by the Bear.\n\nImplementation of a Profiling Interface which will help Bear writer to create a Better Performant Bear.","assignee_display_names":["Makman2","Arjun Singh Yadav","fneu","Grant Parajuli"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6112123772469248,"title":"Leaflet BLurred Location Part 2","subcategory":"back-end","organization":{"id":5220873754116096,"name":"Public Lab","slug":"public-lab","website_url":"http://publiclab.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"web@publiclab.org","mailing_list":"http://publiclab.org/developers","irc_channel":"http://publiclab.org/chat","tagline":"Open hardware and software to help communities measure and analyze pollution","precis":"Open hardware and software to help communities measure and analyze pollution","description":"## Measuring pollution at low cost\n\nPublic Lab is focused on democratizing the tools and techniques of environmental science so that communities who face pollution and other environmental problems can actually use them.\n\nWe believe that low cost, open source, easy to use hardware and software can enable anyone to collect data with which to hold polluters accountable.\n\n## Sensor data and open hardware development\n\nPublic Lab software projects focus on two areas: community collaboration and open hardware development (PublicLab.org), and data processing for our sensors and tools (MapKnitter.org and SpectralWorkbench.org, among others).\n\nOur collaboration and development platform PublicLab.org enables thousands of people to publish updates and share designs for emerging environmental open hardware projects.

Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees.

We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software.

This year, I intend to develop additional features for the RCManager, which includes important tools like the edge prober, and the component list retriever. Apart from these, a number of trivial GUI options (like an exhaustive menu bar) would be added to enhance the usability of this tool. Since this tool deals with components being deployed at remote locations, the involved functionalities would require extensive testing and documentation.

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC.

FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack.

Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again.

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass.

Its goal is to facilitate in-depth studies of silicon-based particle and radiation detectors widely used in high-energy physics. During simulation, Allpix-Squared run events that contains a series of modules that operate on input data — usually in the form of a previous module’s output data. These events aim to mirror the behavior of a particle interacting with a specific detector hardware. Some modules are independent of others, so they can be run in parallel; this is the current state of the multithreading used in the framework, but it does not make good use of available CPU cores. The aim of this proposal is thus to run full events in parallel instead, greatly enhancing CPU core utilization. This however requires some internal restructure and presents new problems not shared with the current approach, such as the issue of event execution order. I aim to solve this issue with dependency graphs. When done, the new multithreading approach should allow better execution time, independent on core count and simulation parameters.","assignee_display_names":["Simon Spannagel","Daniel Hynds"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6196381165813760,"title":"Find Enhancements","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":5694377121284096,"name":"Xi Editor Project","slug":"xi-editor-project","website_url":"https://github.com/google/xi-editor","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"raph@google.com","mailing_list":"https://www.reddit.com/r/xi_editor/","irc_channel":"https://botbot.me/mozilla/xi/","tagline":"A modern text editor with a backend written in Rust.","precis":"A modern text editor with a backend written in Rust.","description":"The xi-editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor,\nusing modern software engineering techniques.

Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable.

The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built.

It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n### What is Matrix’s Mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n### What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n### How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nRecent work on Matrix includes [E2E encryption](https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/) (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), [embeddable widgets](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), [Communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)!\n\n* [Encrypting Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/)\n* [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lj4cCPcRF75WxmtxvnsuTVQ9DqfoGWVHiUuVgV_RIQ11qa4xywfxjEjHxNimWmRkdWYp6HI-CG-kDXcvunZ5ARgRHP1xgg","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/@matrixdotorg","blog_url":"https://matrix.org/blog","application_instructions":"In order to apply to Matrix, students should first get to know the project and community by browsing [the Matrix Specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec) and launching a Matrix client and joining the [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org) chatroom.

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\n\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PxFw8wDQUkPqz5ZVyRaSbNAqQpEotHzm-9_2nsRtf1UpUkX_-UqfAUvmmvVwekrFUrrPbEsPjzFhAwAugQG4EpxwS5WAkA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"(Also available here: https://goo.gl/sR2tnN)\n\nWe would like to know who you are and how you think.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over.

We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become.

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jC07WJ0bFpZFV_QcSPsLCqV_qG0TYR1dHi_Zk9ZV6usiie35fQqXd2YQk3A0mZ53S3mGs0uXh6KbwcxKj0QuCD83UIGGag","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/debian","blog_url":"https://planet.debian.org/","application_instructions":"Individual projects are highlighted on the [projects list](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects).

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command.

Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made.

Our team of engineers helps drive the DNS standards and author the reference implementation that is then distributed as commercial-quality open source software for the Internet community. ISC provides the same leadership both in standards development and software for the DHCP protocol: **ISC DHCP** and **Kea**. Over the years, the ISC team has written over [60 RFCs](https://www.isc.org/community/rfcs/isc-rfcs/); we are proud of our substantial contributions to the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://ietf.org).\n\nAdministrators adopting Kea are looking for new ways to manage their core network services. They are attracted by Kea's separation of lease data from network communications, that facilitates centralized provisioning. They want to leverage Kea's hooks api and REST api to integrate DHCP with other network operations. As the explosion of containerized applications is breaking the old 1:1 relationship of IP addresses to machines, they need more flexibility and automation for services like DNS updating. The Kea team are looking for contributors who want to help us bring this core network management service into the 21st century by improving and extending the monitoring, provisioning, extensibility and performance.\n\nISC is a non-profit company. Our open source software is freely available on our website and on [https://github.com/isc-projects](github).
