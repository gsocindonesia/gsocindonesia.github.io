It provides a lot of basic tools and features to easily test and verify an application developed by a developer. But it has some shortcomings.\n\nTo my understanding, the aim of this project is to provide a platform for the developers to quickly check the changes and validity of the application developed by them.

ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.\n\nReleases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip.

While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations.

A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.\nWith respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision.","assignee_display_names":["Panos Louridas","Markos Gogoulos"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6328829434396672,"title":"Improving the xip tool","subcategory":"xip tool","organization":{"id":4941175300030464,"name":"Boston University / XIA","slug":"boston-university-xia","website_url":"https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux/wiki","category":"cloud","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/linux-xia","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Crowdsourcing the future Internet","precis":"Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project.

To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees.

To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation) rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use (LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g. Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and grasslands.\n\nThis potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g. LSTM) to classify a Sentinel time-series that is able to produce a map for one or more LCLU classes and ship the final version of the model into the Pycoal library as part of the COAL project.","assignee_display_names":["Lewis McGibbney"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6337993686646784,"title":"App Store for Cytoscape Apps","subcategory":"cytoscape","organization":{"id":5342987207311360,"name":"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)","slug":"national-resource-for-network-biology-nrnb","website_url":"http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Developing open source software to enable network-based biomedical discovery","precis":"The National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) organizes the development of free, open source software to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery.","description":"The [National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)](http://www.nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery.

We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qlSB2E0SDXNNVPijKF7LCK1m18Xaot9bQMfoRQWJ76diI85bMOHBaQvr20X3PH-NZplzFSlakZQdAnKWtzBkOzVAT9YXqnSr","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that you are interested in on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

It is clear however, that the brain is active even when the subject is not performing a task. In fact, according to certain estimates, task-related changes in neuronal metabolism only account for about 5% of the brain’s total energy consumption. Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB. In order to increase its diffusion and portability, the repository has to be converted to Python and follow the BIDS - Standards to eventually create the portable neuroimaging pipeline.","assignee_display_names":["Asier Erramuzpe","Daniele Marinazzo","Nigel Colenbier"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6392690430705664,"title":"Enable DEVSIM to simulate solar cells","subcategory":"other","organization":{"id":5253365315928064,"name":"Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation","slug":"free-and-open-source-silicon-foundation","website_url":"https://fossi-foundation.org","category":"other","contact_email":"gsoc@fossi-foundation.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/discussion","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/librecores/Lobby","tagline":"The home for open source hardware, EDA tools and the related ecosystem","precis":"Umbrella for various projects around open source hardware and tools","description":"We are a group of developers and open hardware enthusiasts from the open source silicon community, that formed the FOSSi Foundation.

These aren't just bug-finding tools.  Our tools give a guarantee, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":6561603978264576,"display_name":"Oleg Safonov (binore)","program_year":2018},"abstract":"This project is about enabling coala to deal with multiple programming languages in a single source file","assignee_display_names":["Dong-hee Na","Arrizal Amin","Adhityaa Chandrasekar","Niklas Meinzer"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6407527730774016,"title":"MIMO basics for GNU Radio","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":4829179732819968,"name":"GNU Radio","slug":"gnu-radio","website_url":"https://www.gnuradio.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/MailingLists","irc_channel":"https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/IRC","tagline":"The free & open software radio ecosystem","precis":"GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to design, test and implement software radios.","description":"GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5OimqqP6jx-cBzmfIjjKC-KBHMpNrEDI4Bp8hs2M7eIsz4scVlUX_u43tK_YqKF64xFbWSxvhm3o4Hwg0OC1OiC8Dx0T1XJ-","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/gnuradio","blog_url":"https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Please have a look at our website for detailed [instructions](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GSoCStudentInfo) on how to apply as well as pointers to successful proposals from past years that can be used as a template.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/DBWjJG0U8zHLJxff5uZpE36V0p7XuSkaE8RWMYUeabVcmP5cyPlviIKCW3-rNCp_9hD37sEOT6Qks4YgHhGLiWLDD1cnVlCu","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/llvmorg","blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org","application_instructions":"We strongly suggest each proposal to be discussed first at the corresponding sub-project mailing list (e.g. llvm-dev, cfe-dev, etc.) Prior patch submission to LLVM (or its subprojects) is recommended, but not strictly required.

This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs?

The second objective is to represent the TOCs in an extensive manner by RDF dataset.\n\nStatistical NLP techniques for information retrieval rely heavily on lexicon/words in an article rather than its categorization (contents in a TOC); by expressing TOC as RDF we will create a more powerful way of searching within and across articles. Standard metadata representation i.e. RDF implies less resource intensive task of partial reuse across applications.\n\nThis generated TOC RDF graph visualization can help in exploring multiple Wikipedia pages for hidden semantic links.

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. \n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

This interpretation of real-life objects into 3D space is sufficient for typically solid media such as teapots and chairs. However, this model faces many issues when used to represent dynamic materials such as smoke or clouds, which have innumerable and constant shifts in number and location of vertices, edges, and faces. These types of objects are typically classed and implemented separately as Volumes.\n\nDue to the nature of the materials involved, Volume rendering requires a different set of solutions in regards to data structuring, light sampling, and so on. Quickly becoming an industry standard, OpenVDB is a Volume rendering framework developed by Dreamworks that sees wide usage throughout the graphics industry such as in Pixar's RenderMan and Houdini. It is known for its efficiency in handling sparse data sets and its wide range of filters, transformation operators, compositing tools, and many other features for the creation and robust manipulation of Volumes. Its integration into Cycles will surely further Blender's usage in the 3D graphics scene.","assignee_display_names":["Lukas Stockner"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6425064753332224,"title":"Implementing Missing D3DX APIs","subcategory":"c, linux, windows, gaming, directx, opengl, x11, xml, php","organization":{"id":5095018193223680,"name":"The Wine Project","slug":"the-wine-project","website_url":"https://www.winehq.org/","category":"other","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://www.winehq.org/mailman/listinfo/wine-devel","irc_channel":"https://www.winehq.org/irc","tagline":"Wine runs Windows applications on Linux, BSD, Solaris, macOS and Android.","precis":"Wine runs Windows applications on Linux, BSD, Solaris, macOS and Android","description":"Wine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, Android, Solaris & BSD.

PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made.

In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches.

Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

If you've written code, share it with us. A uni coding assignment is a good example of your work even if you don't have anything else. \n- Try to upload your code to GitHub (or a similar repository) if you can. Remember that if it's easy for us to examine and run, we're more likely to be interested than if all we receive is a zip file with no instructions. \n- A little-known secret: Open source code isn't only about the code. We'd also like to see evidence of your communication, project management, and documentation skills.\n- Biology knowledge is a bonus but is definitely not required. \n- Please visit our [GSoC site](http://intermine.org/gsoc/guidance/students-applying/) for full guidance and application details.\n\n## Custom ideas\nIf you're comfortable enough with InterMine's APIs (or data, or codebase) to propose your own project idea, we'd love to discuss it with you!

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.

We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.\n\n# Improving Education with Innovative Technology\nQuill was recently featured in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and the [Google Machine Learning blog](https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/) for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers. \n\nLearners begin by completing a [diagnostic activity](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even [special versions of the diagnostic](https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692) for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)\n\nQuill has a variety of activity types, including [a real-time classroom lessons mode](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons), [a sentence construction tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [a proofreading practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) and [a grammar practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar).\n\nEach tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nUp until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xb52vhYNsuo9ZCw2a5cSKmpPuq6LpCSQABJLArsH6_JJRm2zkNfYrpzQ5gZZRpgXV8dNoTmo9lbTtwJ8a2wMzZhYRK0zBFI","image_bg_color":"00c3a2","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/quill_org","blog_url":"https://medium.com/writing-with-quill","application_instructions":"To apply to Quill.org for Google Summer of Code, please use the following template:\n\n# Project Idea\n**What is your project idea?**\nBriefly describe the idea you have for your project.

To make the visualization of biocircuits more efficient and amenable to automation, my goal is to upgrade DNAplotlib to support highly customizable visualizations of genetic circuits from SBOL version 2 files. \nI will achieve this by integrating DNAplotlib with the pySBOL2 library to support reading and writing of SBOL2 files. The current DNAplotlib only support SBOL 1.0 documentation, and thus is only capable of manifesting DNA components consisted of DNA sequence and sequence annotation. It cannot represent complex interactions between different subcomponents, and thus has poor connectivity with other genetic platforms. Through my work this summer, DNAplotlib will (1) incorporate non-DNA components / partially complete design sequences (2) document and link to external models such as SBML and CellML (3) visualize hierarchical and modular biosystems (4) save customization into SBOL file.","assignee_display_names":["Bryan Bartley","Thomas Gorochowski"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6482576244473856,"title":"Enable building of gRPC Python with Bazel","subcategory":"building","organization":{"id":6309297353392128,"name":"gRPC","slug":"grpc","website_url":"https://grpc.io","category":"cloud","contact_email":"grpc-io@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io","irc_channel":"https://grpc.io/community/","tagline":"A high performance, open-source universal RPC framework","precis":"gRPC - A high performance, open-source universal RPC framework","description":"gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment.

This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL).

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.

There is no builtin trace visualizer in HPX which would allow for better understanding of program execution. To tackle this currently, the workaround used is to use the APEX library to generate trace files using the OTF2 library so that these could be loaded into a licensed software called Vampir. Although this works, the need for the license to be able to visualize the traces seems a bit restrictive. Apart from this, a custom simple text profiler is utilized which allows for dumping start and end times which are then loaded in nvprof using python scripts for visualization. But given that HPX can be used to work on a huge number of tasks, nvprof cannot handle large traces. Additionally, separate python scripts are employed for the task of generating plots and histograms depicting useful information. Ravel is another tool that already exists and has a nice GUI but lacks certain features that would be useful for the developers of HPX.

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XCt4HLVLBx42GYGRmAtfDTTuHSrRiDU9UQ82mG1UovWoKNVe8oC2mZSbEQ2LCOnSWcBIAnQNtqjI14XvD96Jl4qrNR9EhEg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode.

We try to fix programs with pre-condition and post-condition written in separation logic. Given a program, we first run JSF to collect its post-state(p) by symbolic execution with the given pre-condition. Then we check if p entails the given post-condition(p'). If not, a bug is detected. Our approach to program repair has two main components: abduction and repair specification inference. First, we propose to infer the missing information to establish the post-condition through abduction using an existing solver. In particular, we infer a constraint f such that p \\* f is satisfied and p \\* f |-> p'. Secondly, based on abduction, we symbolically execute the input program with the abduction in a backward manner in order to construct repair specifications at every line of the input program. These repair specifications help to infer valid Hoare-style triples with fix candidates.","assignee_display_names":["THANHVU NGUYEN","Quang Loc Le","Quoc-Sang Phan"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6529112886214656,"title":"Hair Rendering II - Hair shader and binary format","subcategory":"rendering","organization":{"id":5168478307221504,"name":"appleseedhq","slug":"appleseedhq","website_url":"https://appleseedhq.net/","category":"graphics","contact_email":"hello@appleseedhq.net","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/appleseed-dev","irc_channel":"https://slackin-naplrzjfoz.now.sh/","tagline":"A modern open source rendering engine for animation and visual effects","precis":"appleseed is a modern, open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.","description":"# Overview\n\nappleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.\n\nappleseed is actively developed since 2012 by a small, international team of talented volunteers from the animation and VFX industry.

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.\n\nCurrent research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/D_C7uJjwDFU-9qxb21PF93nKuyl6Sw21r1w_aeFBJgOX6FTyyihB105bu0Mg0GBShTNXW0GDxdnfPTSDI580-HRlzO2EFF96","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/clipsua","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Don't write a tweet, but don't write a book either.

In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics.

It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/YzzBiWTFmmsUCpU-IR7Wfh4eT-QX3LorMIF6vCdrWDWeh5s5hTxLL8khaeabQ0EPqCzWwEFaTvhQ9GUJIrEOpehy5t7o06Kf","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ensembl","blog_url":"http://www.ensembl.info/","application_instructions":"Start early and pay attention to Google's student manual and the timeline.

In addition, it is very important to develop your own solution for running eHive-pipelines in the OpenStack cloud. The cloud controller in eHive will be implemented in the same way. A cloud controller is one or more nodes that control cloud operations. Unlike cloud work nodes (for example, compute nodes), the cloud controller supports high-level representation of cloud resources and provides a single point for managing clouds. First, the user's request (for example, the launch of the instance) is included in the cloud controller node, and then, according to the request, it sends to other nodes (for example, calculate, store or network nodes) to complete the operation.","assignee_display_names":["Brandon Walts","Matthieu Muffato"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6585846384295936,"title":"Support Groovy implementations in the  Netbeans IDE plugin","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5718432427802624,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"https://apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.","description":"The Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits contributors potential legal exposure.

There is **single job producer** -- worker which reads the data and pushes the chunks into the job queue. Also, there are **many job consumers** -- workers which pull the chunks and update the model parameters in parallel.\n\nThe problem is that consumers'  code is optimized well, so this leads to **workers starvation** problem. Job producer just can't fill the queue at such a high pace. This is the case even using fastest `read the line, split it and yield` corpus iterator.\n\nThis problem could be solved by allowing users to pass `K` data streams (currently only single-stream == single job producer thread is supported), e.g. which point to `K` large files and use `K` job producers to fill the job queue.","assignee_display_names":["Jayant Jain","Ivan Menshikh"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6587806298669056,"title":"ROS Package for Robot Work Cell Discovery","subcategory":"ros","organization":{"id":5366449791565824,"name":"Open Source Robotics Foundation","slug":"mr","website_url":"https://www.osrfoundation.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc@osrfoundation.org","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Our mission is to support the development of OSS for use in robotics","precis":"Our mission is to support the development, distribution, and adoption of open source software for use in robotics research, education, and product development.","description":"Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":6248094182670336,"display_name":"Nitanshu Vashistha","program_year":2018},"abstract":"Security hardening, testing infrastructure and configurability for corobo","assignee_display_names":["Max Hahn","Alexander Voronkov","Meet Mangukiya","gbin"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6603786395582464,"title":"webpack-cli: Infrastructure and Automation Work - Dhruvdutt","subcategory":"webpack","organization":{"id":4657420148670464,"name":"webpack","slug":"webpack","website_url":"https://webpack.js.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"webpack@opencollective.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"http://webpack.js.org","tagline":"webpack is THE build tool for modern web applications run on NodeJS","precis":"webpack is THE build solution for modern web and NodeJS applications","description":"**webpack is a module bundler**.

We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack will be re-implemented in other JS-like languages or low-level languages, and WebAssembly binaries will be generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools will be used or developed to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained. Besides, Node.js C++ Addons will also be tried as an option to compare the improvement in overall performance.  It can be considered to be a significant performance enhancement with this project in the future Webpack release.","assignee_display_names":["Tobias Koppers","Sean Larkin","Even Stensberg"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6613861851987968,"title":"Adding more data repository support to DataDepsGenerators.jl","subcategory":"julia","organization":{"id":5724916167475200,"name":"NumFOCUS","slug":"numfocus","website_url":"https://www.numfocus.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"info@numfocus.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Open Code = Better Science","precis":"The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research.","description":"NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.

Specifically, I will develop an extension for WebSocket add-on by adding some Active Scans. The Active scan will include tests to web application in SQL Injections vulnerabilities.To accomplish my idea I will test web application using Time Based techniques.\nAnother significant vulnerability is that the WebSocket protocol doesn’t handle authentication. Practically this means that, a WebSocket opened from a page behind authentication  doesn’t “automatically” receive any sort of authentication. That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client. Some other posible attacks and scans at WebSockets are the classic bruteforce attack, Local and Remote file inclusion, the Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. I am going to implement some of the above scans, (as more as possible) starting with SQls Injections. I strongly believe that we could easily add the scans if the basic infrastructure was build.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":4883047543996416,"display_name":"Sangam Kumar","program_year":2018},"abstract":"# Improve Lint Bear Quality\nThe aim of the project is to improve linter bears in coala by improving the testing API that adds support for global bears, adding base test helper class, automating the tests for bears, adding support for 7 additional linter bears and enhancing the documentation for coala API and coala-bears.","assignee_display_names":["Max Hahn","Ipshita Chatterjee","Niklas Meinzer","Abdeali Kothari"],"program_year":2018},{"id":6627107531128832,"title":"OCR on Nutritional Facts Table","subcategory":"computer vision","organization":{"id":5282542639382528,"name":"Open Food Facts","slug":"open-food-facts","website_url":"https://world.openfoodfacts.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"contact@openfoodfacts.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://slack-ssl-openfoodfacts.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"A collaborative, free and open database of food and cosmetic products.","precis":"Help people around the globe make better food choices by letting them create an open database of all food and cosmetic products in the world, using their mobile phones.","description":"## A food and cosmetic product database ##\n\nOpen Food Facts is a database of food and cosmetic products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the ata we can find on product labels.\n\n## Made by everyone ##\n\nOpen Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.\nSince 2012, 7000+ contributors have added 400 000+ products from 180 countries using the Android, iPhone or Windows Phone apps or their cameras to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.\n\n## For everyone ##\n\nData about food and cosmetics is of public interest and has to be open.

Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.\n\nOn the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\n\nThe LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mFSTc-0kBDxavaRe7oDS5b7Rz8f-b8kleQbgWShrg5F5eta1a0F2FOp3QFKD7DS1KhT7gNO1WkbP5Cr758NtEVYMT4MlJ_jw","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/leapcode","blog_url":"https://leap.se/en/about-us/news","application_instructions":"Hi!

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.
