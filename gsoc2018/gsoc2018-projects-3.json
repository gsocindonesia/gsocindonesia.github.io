LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/EJ7vLvAQgTYtEf213LNLThezRCTdu8dPMY2n5X9I_1kNMQdV9pfz9D_GBk1dTv3RSiOsEo6KmKnRbnf1wNMOW3hsAnQ4Og","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"https://blog.openmrs.org/","application_instructions":"Students interested in applying to GSoC 2018 to work on an OpenMRS project are asked to complete a Google Summer of Code 2018 application and provide the following information:\n# Who are you?

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/q6OBCzxGyvqIIGkRM9EOg5pQu2hmw4AFL8SZVj4hMGkhnfLkHZoJGVgOYsrT3DWraaDXfkJrlkSHof9rrNsQAdqxX_itjRs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"In order to apply to CERN-HSF, please visit the following website:\nhttp://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html\nThere you will find a list of proposals for each project, their description and the contact information of their mentors.

This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.\n \nSituations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously.","assignee_display_names":["Randy Mackay","Jaime Machuca"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5233910938599424,"title":"GRASS GIS module for Sentinel-2 cloud and shadow detection","subcategory":"grass gis","organization":{"id":5051492877205504,"name":"OSGeo","slug":"open-source-geospatial-foundation","website_url":"https://osgeo.org","category":"other","contact_email":"gsoc-admin@osgeo.org","mailing_list":"https://www.osgeo.org/community/communications/","irc_channel":"https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students#How_to_get_in_contact_via_IRC","tagline":"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation","precis":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community.","description":"<pre>\nOSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community in general and several code projects in particular:\n\n## *Web Mapping* ##\n\ndeegree, geomajas, GeoMOOSE, GeoServer, Mapbender, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers\n\n## *Desktop Applications* ##\n\nGRASS GIS, gvSIG, Marble, QGIS\n\n## *Geospatial Libraries* ##\n\nFDO, GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, OSSIM, PostGIS\n\n## *Metadata Catalogues* ##\n\nGeoNetwork, pycsw\n\n## *Content Management Systems* ##\n\nGeoNode\n\n## *Other Incubating Projects* ##\n\nistSOS, MetaCRS, Opticks, Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), PyWPS, Team Engine, ZOO-Project\n\n## *Other (non-code) Projects* ##\n\nGeoForAll (Education and Curriculum), OSGeo-Live DVD, Public Geospatial Data\n\nWe host regional and international FOSS4G conferences with typical attendance of 500-1100+ geospatial developers, industry and government leaders, and researchers.

The procedure allows to automatically identify clouds and their shadows in Sentinel 2 images applying some rules on reflectance values (values thresholds, comparisons between bands, etc.). These have been defined starting from rules found in literature and conveniently refined. Then the detection of shadows is improved using an adapted shape index. In order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a control check is implemented. Clouds and shadows are spatially intersected in order to remove misclassified areas.

Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack.

We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

Those models that come from speech recognition seem to be particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. The present project proposes to create a working implementation of a speech recognition model using the Flux library for the Julia programming language and contribute its code to the Flux model zoo. The model to be implemented is Zhang et al.'s (2017) model from their paper \"Towards end-to-end speech recognition with deep convolutional neural networks.\" Due to being implemented using only convolutional layers, this model will be lighter to train than previous models that have used heavier recurrent layers, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance. Having a working implementation of this network will be a step forward in opening the culture of automatic speech recognition. As a result, newcomers to the field will have a recent example to look at for inspiration, which is paramount because there are not many novice-friendly resources available for doing speech recognition research.","assignee_display_names":["Mike Innes","Christopher Rackauckas"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5274625081081856,"title":"Tower Defence Gameplay Template","subcategory":"gameplay","organization":{"id":4831005211361280,"name":"MovingBlocks","slug":"movingblocks","website_url":"http://terasology.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"terasology@gmail.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC","tagline":"Terasology: like an open source Minecraft - imagine the possibilities!","precis":"MovingBlocks is a group of open source enthusiasts working on a voxel game engine inspired by Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and more.","description":"# Why Terasology\n\nWe set out to see how an open source and super extensible voxel game inspired by Minecraft could go beyond it and offer gameplay like seen in Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/FUXX2UQkfp2LI-ztXZFi2Id_BIbdi0rWWzj6JERVRFI2-lqaXn2fBFkdlVKCNjT4hAXfK8cHl68RYbIfJfyK22tiZlxPfv0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/metasploit","blog_url":"https://blog.rapid7.com/tag/metasploit/","application_instructions":"Send the following to msfdev@metasploit.com\n\n\n## Title\n\nA brief description of what you would like to work on.

This project also focuses on streamlining test cases for different geometries and data styles to improve the runtime of tests.

GUI of “show” is written by glui framework now, but glui framework is old and difficult to maintain.  Therefore, it is necessary to replace “show” GUI with a more general framework such as Qt5.  3DTK developers have already started this rewriting, and this project is called “qtshow”.  However, “qtshow” still misses a lot of functionality compared to  “show”.  Because of this, I improve these problems and add some features which are in “show” but not in “qtshow”.","assignee_display_names":["Johannes Schauer"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5329095265615872,"title":"Upgrade to Rails 5","subcategory":"back-end","organization":{"id":5220873754116096,"name":"Public Lab","slug":"public-lab","website_url":"http://publiclab.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"web@publiclab.org","mailing_list":"http://publiclab.org/developers","irc_channel":"http://publiclab.org/chat","tagline":"Open hardware and software to help communities measure and analyze pollution","precis":"Open hardware and software to help communities measure and analyze pollution","description":"## Measuring pollution at low cost\n\nPublic Lab is focused on democratizing the tools and techniques of environmental science so that communities who face pollution and other environmental problems can actually use them.\n\nWe believe that low cost, open source, easy to use hardware and software can enable anyone to collect data with which to hold polluters accountable.\n\n## Sensor data and open hardware development\n\nPublic Lab software projects focus on two areas: community collaboration and open hardware development (PublicLab.org), and data processing for our sensors and tools (MapKnitter.org and SpectralWorkbench.org, among others).\n\nOur collaboration and development platform PublicLab.org enables thousands of people to publish updates and share designs for emerging environmental open hardware projects.

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/4MDzw_NjNaZ5AM-CCoMRmYEQSaGNCoBsTrlYnZLM3w7QNv9s29jkgeEwwpRD4ZNgH7RF6u4BtcxFlgJq6NG_SgGGJ8-ugQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"https://planet.FreeBSD.org/","application_instructions":"Please look at our [instructions for applying with FreeBSD](https://gsoc.FreeBSD.org/) which includes lots of details on producing a good proposal that stands a better chance of being accepted.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":6014247373373440,"display_name":"Vamshi Krishna","program_year":2018},"abstract":"GitMate.io is an automation tool for developers.

To improve this situation the student should design a semi-automatic system to grant access to trusted routers to LibreNet6 (this may include key exchange) and code a tiny LiMe module that take care of tunnel configuration.","assignee_display_names":["nicoechaniz","Gioacchino Mazzurco"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5354810442776576,"title":"Support Static Type-Checking of gRPC Python and of Code Using gRPC Python","subcategory":"verification","organization":{"id":6309297353392128,"name":"gRPC","slug":"grpc","website_url":"https://grpc.io","category":"cloud","contact_email":"grpc-io@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io","irc_channel":"https://grpc.io/community/","tagline":"A high performance, open-source universal RPC framework","precis":"gRPC - A high performance, open-source universal RPC framework","description":"gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment.

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software.

One can also use it as a viewer to overlay cancer genomics data on existing \"template\" pathways like those that appeared in TCGA papers. Ultimately, this project has two main purposes. First one is improving PathwayMapper with new attaractive features for both local and colloborative modes. Second one is integrating PathwayMapper into cBioPortal as an alternative to the cBioPortal's current network view.","assignee_display_names":["Ugur Dogrusoz","Onur","JJ Gao"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5390855418937344,"title":"Implement the support for Research Object specification into Nextflow framework","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5340733272227840,"name":"Open Bioinformatics Foundation","slug":"open-bioinformatics-foundation","website_url":"https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc@mailman.open-bio.org","mailing_list":"http://obf.github.io/GSoC/contact/","irc_channel":"http://obf.github.io/GSoC/contact/","tagline":"Promoting practice & philosophy of OSS & Open Science in biological research.","precis":"Promoting practice & philosophy of OSS & Open Science in biological research.","description":"The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.\n\nOur main activities are:\n* Running and supporting the BOSC conferences.\n* Organizing and supporting developer-centric \"Hackathon\" events.\n* Participating in the Google Summer of Code program on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.\n* Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our member projects.\n* Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.\n\nThe Foundation does not participate directly in the development or structure of the open source work, but as the members of the foundation are drawn from our projects' developer communities, there is clear commonality of direction and purpose.\n\nThe OBF is governed by a Board of Directors.

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/F_FWRzu838WIU-EDb-Teq9Y7OxaJSmqqIsl_aWHUQba98QrinymiU6iwPJYKSYcw5ghNPwVN6Ln3jsukc5Cam4gizRflkw","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"https://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [projects page](https://projects.freifunk.net) and select the idea you like.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.

This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL).

We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kWqF0bT_hHDVRLhg2pJhsFghmGZEWTTIqBSe5XOZKNDMyObRv__UjSH8d-Sf6eqvBxglXqtAD3u93Qzgqbv9vz4B_0-IXJo","image_bg_color":"000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too. Our projects cover a wide range of programming languages and technologies. Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level systems type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through interesting data analysis, to data presentation projects building more effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org.

Moreover, revamping the way in which mitmproxy stores captures and, in general, data, will open the road to store, together with flows, hot configurations and other fields, thus building the infrastructure to store sessions on the disk. During the summer, my task will be to work together with my mentors to design and implement a new serialization process, first as an isolated addon, later interfacing it to the core.","assignee_display_names":["Aldo Cortesi","Maximilian Hils","Thomas Kriechbaumer"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5441752727552000,"title":"Improve the Kiwix Android app’s CI setup and increase the code coverage","subcategory":"testing","organization":{"id":5569026554593280,"name":"Kiwix","slug":"kiwix","website_url":"http://www.kiwix.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"gsoc@kiwix.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#kiwix","tagline":"Internet content for people without internet access","precis":"Kiwix brings internet content to people without internet access.

Kiwix runs on most platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux) and is, of course, free to use.\n\nThe software passed the million direct downloads mark at the end of 2016, 80% of these users being in the Global South. Kiwix is also used by a host of organizations around the world, be it in rural schools of Western and Southern Africa or education and rehabilitation programs in US and European prisons. There are also uses we hadn't planned for: Kiwix is for instance [distributed by the Cuban government](https://www.ecured.cu/EcuMóvil) to help people save on data costs, or by NGOs in North Korea trying to [smuggle uncensored information](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/) into the hermit kingdom. \n\nWe have recently started releasing \"custom apps\"; that is, Android apps that are based on the Kiwix engine but offer only a specific piece of content. A good example is WikiMed, an application that offers medical content from Wikipedia in 10 languages: again, it is particularly popular in the Global South (India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iraq and Egypt, but to name a few of our larger user bases).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VXhrMpNEvBCyUaKuCRtQQngddrYs7RQHgk-dlALxgcn-4tNxSLfAgDlj21YYsT5yUgBYKNVu-ceFgX0HIOkb_WfMyPI6og","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/kiwixoffline","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"### Kiwix GSoC Application Instructions\nGet in contact with us via email or IRC, so we can help you fill out the following application question template. \n## GENERAL APPLICATION QUESTIONS\n# Have you participated in Google Summer of Code in the past?\n# Have you participated in Google Code-in in the past?\n# Do you have any prior open source experience?\n# Do you currently have any other summer commitments?\n# How many hours are you able to devote to your chosen project each week?\n# Do you have any experience using source control e.g. Git?\n# Have you ever used IRC?\n# Do you plan on contributing to our project after GSoC is over?\n## PROJECT QUESTIONS\n# What project idea do you wish to complete and why do you think you are in a good position to complete it?\n# Give a brief description of the aims of the project.\n# Give a summary of how you would intend to complete this project.\n# Give a timeline of the milestones which you expect to accomplish along the path to completion.\n# Give a list of any potential challenges you can see at this point and how you would go about overcoming them.\n# Is there any further work that could be done after GSoC to improve work done during?\n# How will you managed your time during the program to ensure goals are met?\n# How have you decided to communicate with your mentors and how often?\n# Any other information that you think would be beneficial to your application?","topic_tags":["offline","android"],"technology_tags":["android","java","c++","python","qt"],"proposal_tags":["feature","testing","user experience","custom apps","multi zim"],"ideas_list":"http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/GSoC","contact_method":"gsoc@kiwix.org","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":5762660604313600,"display_name":"Siddharth Sharma","program_year":2018},"abstract":"This project aims to improve the existing test infrastructure (as well as write new tests), and  refactoring parts of the code to improve test-ability and readability.\n\nThis is done by first improving the architecture of the app to “MVP-with-RxJava”.

One such support is automatic reauthentication when the application terminates the session being used for testing, either defensively or for other reasons so that subsequent requests are ineffective until the session is restored. With the current implementation, a user must manually configure ZAP to handle authentication. This is time-consuming and error-prone. This project targets to allow ZAP to help detect login and registration pages and provide more assistance when configuring authentication, ideally being able to completely automate the task for as many sorts of web apps as possible.\n\nExpected Results:\n• Automatic detection of login and registration pages.\n• A wizard to walk users through the process of setting up authentication, with as much assistance as possible.\n• An option to completely automate the authentication process, for as many authentication mechanisms as possible.","assignee_display_names":["Rick M","Ricardo Pereira"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5451729601036288,"title":"Composite Label Indices & Alerts rule testing","subcategory":"prometheus","organization":{"id":6453865516367872,"name":"Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)","slug":"cloud-native-computing-foundation-cncf","website_url":"https://www.cncf.io/","category":"cloud","contact_email":"info@cncf.io","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":"https://github.com/cncf/soc/issues","tagline":"Sustaining open source cloud native projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus","precis":"The CNCF promotes cloud native computing across the industry and sustains open source cloud native projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, gRPC, Envoy and more!","description":"The CNCF was founded in 2015 with the mission to promote cloud native computing across the industry and provide a home for the Kubernetes community and related open source projects.

A few examples in the literature use different approaches to the problem, and calculate the different spectrum of the light emitted at different phases of these oscillations.

We release open source clients, SDKs, servers and bridges as well as maintain the spec!","description":"### What is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n### What is Matrix’s Mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n### What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n### How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nRecent work on Matrix includes [E2E encryption](https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/) (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), [embeddable widgets](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), [Communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)!\n\n* [Encrypting Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/)\n* [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lj4cCPcRF75WxmtxvnsuTVQ9DqfoGWVHiUuVgV_RIQ11qa4xywfxjEjHxNimWmRkdWYp6HI-CG-kDXcvunZ5ARgRHP1xgg","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/@matrixdotorg","blog_url":"https://matrix.org/blog","application_instructions":"In order to apply to Matrix, students should first get to know the project and community by browsing [the Matrix Specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec) and launching a Matrix client and joining the [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org) chatroom.  Students may also wish to hang out in #matrix:matrix.org or #matrix-dev:matrix.org to better understand the project.\n\nA good next starting point is to play with the Matrix API to send and perhaps receive some instant messages - or experiment with some of the more unusual Matrix clients which are currently in development.  Another good bet would be to try installing a Matrix homeserver (e.g. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) to get a feeling for the technology involved.\n\nWe then suggest thoroughly reading through our [GSoC Ideas List](https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md) and asking questions on #gsoc:matrix.org about the items which interest you.

On desktop, this situation prevents writing clients, bots and bridges that can interact with encrypted rooms in any other language than javascript. Tackling this issue would benefit the matrix ecosystem by seeing more featureful projects emerge in a variety of languages (Python in this case). It also supports the Matrix long-term goal of having E2E encryption turned on by default in private rooms.","assignee_display_names":["Richard van der Hoff"],"program_year":2018},{"id":5469040533831680,"title":"Add Continuous Scan and Thorough Product Addition using OCR in Native Android Application","subcategory":"android","organization":{"id":5282542639382528,"name":"Open Food Facts","slug":"open-food-facts","website_url":"https://world.openfoodfacts.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"contact@openfoodfacts.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://slack-ssl-openfoodfacts.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"A collaborative, free and open database of food and cosmetic products.","precis":"Help people around the globe make better food choices by letting them create an open database of all food and cosmetic products in the world, using their mobile phones.","description":"## A food and cosmetic product database ##\n\nOpen Food Facts is a database of food and cosmetic products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the ata we can find on product labels.\n\n## Made by everyone ##\n\nOpen Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.\nSince 2012, 7000+ contributors have added 400 000+ products from 180 countries using the Android, iPhone or Windows Phone apps or their cameras to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.\n\n## For everyone ##\n\nData about food and cosmetics is of public interest and has to be open.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":6249576013496320,"display_name":"Pareksha Manchanda","program_year":2018},"abstract":"Through this project coala users will no longer have to worry about searching for the bear or remembering the name of the bear appropriate for their work.

(https://jitsi.org/meet)\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web.

You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.\r\n* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\r\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\r\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jC07WJ0bFpZFV_QcSPsLCqV_qG0TYR1dHi_Zk9ZV6usiie35fQqXd2YQk3A0mZ53S3mGs0uXh6KbwcxKj0QuCD83UIGGag","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/debian","blog_url":"https://planet.debian.org/","application_instructions":"Individual projects are highlighted on the [projects list](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects).

Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.\n\nOn the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\n\nThe LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mFSTc-0kBDxavaRe7oDS5b7Rz8f-b8kleQbgWShrg5F5eta1a0F2FOp3QFKD7DS1KhT7gNO1WkbP5Cr758NtEVYMT4MlJ_jw","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/leapcode","blog_url":"https://leap.se/en/about-us/news","application_instructions":"Hi!

We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software.

Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rTp4Mwh74BD6J_LxJ9DNVQUK9i71S3-F4bZP1mLUhc5YDeCd0GTJIGkgboUoVDSwD3cFW6w7AB0YlD5cZ8UOCXx-UKx90Q","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/intermineorg","blog_url":"https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/","application_instructions":"Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code!

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xbNNxmOK9vsF1Nh34aDV_VJQHzEOSgCleG99BfkwL48oanpg9NFAiPxkEUp_j19nryhNnU_EgvRv02R1AcLeHNLg6IHEFic","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/@processingorg","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wDrytfhfMNK4vvg7hIkUMyZRTTPW9y125eE9wusFTC6vNK2yoPVykwOLb5crWKzuP7hgq8JZlIOkiukibGo4lL5B5Me4cK2L","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/110223386465813667851","twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/coala_io","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io/","application_instructions":"Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.","topic_tags":["code analysis","chatops","devops","language server","dependency management"],"technology_tags":["django","python 3","antlr","emberjs","reactjs"],"proposal_tags":["gitmate","corobo","integration","linter","coala","editor-plugin","community"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2018},"student":{"id":5106368663519232,"display_name":"Ankit Joshi","program_year":2018},"abstract":"The idea, here, is to integrate **pyflakes-enhanced AST** into coala as a **metabear** which can then be used to develop various plugins.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments.

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free.

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.
